         <p class="para">This section describes each element in the Balisage Conference Paper tag set. The
            elements are described here in alphabetical order of their tag names (i.e., element type
            names). The tag name is the shorter machine-readable name used in tagged documents, for
            example, the tag name <a href="n-8fc0.html" target="main" title="Cross-Reference"><span class="elementtag">&lt;xref&gt;</span></a> is used for
            the element named <a href="n-8fc0.html" target="main" title="<xref&gt;"><span class="elementname">Cross-Reference</span></a>.
         </p>
         <p class="para">Each element is described by a separate HTML page, where the heading for the page
            displays the element’s tag name followed by its longer descriptive name. The rest
            of the element description page discusses aspects of the element and its usage. These
            sections within the page always appear in the following order although any given element
            description may not contain all the sections:
