         <h1 class="header">Introduction to Attributes</h1>
         <p class="para">This section describes each attribute used in the Balisage Conference Paper model.
            The attributes are described here in alphabetical order of their tag names (i.e.,
            attribute type names). The tag name is the shorter machine-readable name used in tagged
            documents, for example, the tag name “<a href="n-v6c0.html" target="main" title="Alignment"><span class="attrtag">@align</span></a>” is used for the attribute named “<a href="n-v6c0.html" target="main" title="Alignment"><span class="attrtag">@align</span></a>”.
         </p>
         <p class="para">Each attribute is described by a separate HTML page, where the heading for the page
            displays the attribute’s tag name followed by its longer descriptive name. The
            rest of the attribute description page discusses aspects of the attribute, its usage,
            and the elements to which it can be attached. These sections within the page always
            appear in the following order although any given attribute description may not contain
            all the sections:

                        dictionary definition, but more an explanation of what the attribute means,
                        what type of information it provides, or how it can be used.

                              attributes whose value is any character data (i.e., not a specific

                     <p class="para"><em>Elements</em> — The elements that may take
                        the attribute are named following the phrase “In element:”. For
                        each element, both the tag name (the shorter element type name) and the longer
                        descriptive name are given.
                     </p>
                     <p class="para">If the attribute can be used in more than one way, or with several slightly
                        different meanings, there will be more than one “In element:”
                        section. Each “In element:” section is followed by a value table
                        that describes the attribute’s values when it is used with the specific
                        elements just listed. For example, the attribute may have exactly the same
                        meaning whenever it is used, but sometimes it is required while other times it
                        is optional, so there will be two “In element:” sections, one
                        naming all the elements for which the attribute is required, and one naming all
                        the elements for which the attribute is optional.
                     </p>
                     <p class="para"><em>Values</em> — Following each “In
                        element:” section is an Attribute Value Table that lists the possible
                        values of the attribute and explains the values.
                     </p>
                     <p class="para">The Attribute Value Table typically contains two columns although a third
                        column titled “Behavior” may be present. Each row in the table
                        describes one value, where:
                     </p>
                     <ul class="bullist">
                        <li>The entry in the column titled “Value” names or describes
                           the value,
                        </li>
                        <li>The entry in the column titled “Meaning” explains the
                           meaning of the attribute value or describes potential content for the
                           value, and
                        </li>
                        <li>Where present, the entry in the column titled “Behavior”
                           describes what an XML application might do with the attribute
                           value.
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p class="para">The last row of the table begins with the word “Restriction:”.
                        This row indicates whether the attribute <em>must</em>
                        be supplied when the relevant element is used or is optional and <em>may</em> be supplied. A default value, if any exists, is
                        also provided.

                        attributes whose value is defined as text (letters, numbers, or special
                        characters), the model does not enforce any particular value(s), but a list of
                        suggested values may be provided.
