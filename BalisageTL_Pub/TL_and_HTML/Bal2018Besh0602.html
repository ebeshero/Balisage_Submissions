               <p class="title"><b>Abstract</b></p>
               <p>Developing the Frankenstein Variorum Project has necessitated a reconciliation of
                  extremely divergent markup ecosystems supporting multiple editions of a single
                  novel. The reconciliation process involves breaking or flattening the original
                  hierarchies to prioritize units of low-level lateral intersection, points shared in
                  common to construct <q>bridge</q> or intermediary formats for processing
                  with automated collation via collateX. The output from the automated collation
                  process also serves as an intermediary format that we transform into a TEI form of
                  <span class="ital">standoff parallel segmentation</span>, in which
                  standoff pointing mechanisms operate like a switchboard for connecting the
                  individual editions which can remain (for the most part) undisturbed or unmarked
                  from the collation process. The TEI <q>standoff bridge</q> negotiates the
                  distinct markup ecosystems in ways that can break the <q>silo</q> effect of
                  isolating specially encoded editions. Far from an ephemeral support structure, the
                  standoff bridge upholds the whole as the <q>backbone</q> of the variorum
                  project because it improves the interoperability and interchangeability of all the
                  markup ecosystems involved. Building the standoff bridge effectively reconstitutes
                  the hierarchies in a way that expresses intersections essentially as a graph
                  structure of nodes with edge pointers to comparable nodes.
               </p>
               <p>Our experience on the Frankenstein Variorum is consistent with other TEI projects
                  that involve curating divergence, variance, and forking in text streams. Taken
                  together, such projects illuminate how the TEI can organize textual data in ways
                  other than an ordered hierarchy of content objects, and that the TEI can be turned
                  to express unordered <q>lateral</q> intersections in ways that serve
                  long-standing goals of the TEI community: interchangeability and interoperability
                  of
                  electronic texts. As Syd Bauman in particular has discussed, where
                  interchangeability reflects the capacity for humans to negotiate and adapt to markup
                  ecosystems from systematic navigation and documentation without needing to contact
                  the encoder for help, interoperability reflects the capacity of software tools to
                  process the markup without needing to change the markup (or the tool). Although we
                  usually consider the needs of software interoperability as at odds with the richly
                  expressive capacity of human-readable semantic interchange, this paper demonstrates
                  that the TEI can be designed to prioritize the interests of both, from facilitating
                  automated collation to generating an interlinking web interface that gives the user
                  means to choose and change directions in navigating multiple editions as
                  desired.

            </h2>
            <p>In her keynote address at the 2016 conference meeting of the Text Encoding Initiative
               in Vienna, Tara Andrews broached the issue of whether TEI can really be considered
               a
               <q>de facto standard</q> for the encoding and interchange of digital texts.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e131" class="footnoteref" id="d1e131-ref">[1]</a></sup> Her talk broached a long-recognized issue that the TEI Guidelines permit too
               many choices, so that for practical purposes there is very little that can be
               practically interoperable via simple programmatic mapping from one TEI project’s markup
               ecosystem to another. The TEI might well be a garden of too many forking paths, too
               richly labyrinthine because too entertaining of multiple modes of expression. Although
               Andrews’s talk specifically addressed the lack of interoperability in scholarly editions
               built with TEI and a lack of available software tools to process universally all TEI
               documents, we might take this as a more fundamental concern that the TEI has not
               fulfilled a more basic promise of its origins. That is, beyond its difficulties in
               achieving interoperability, perhaps the Text Encoding Initiative as a wild ecosystem
               fails to live up to the ideal vaunted in the title of its documentation as
               <q>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</q>. Perhaps,
               too, it might be said that those of us who work with TEI do not sufficiently prioritize
               either interoperability or interchangeability in our projects. The goal of universal
               interoperation may simply be unrealistic for rich variety of applications employed
               around the world for the TEI, but interoperability among related kinds of documents
               would seem practically attainable. In the case study of the Frankenstein Variorum
               project presented in this paper, we exemplify and attempt to solve the problem of
               achieving interchangeability among different digital editions of the same novel in
               variant forms, by developing intermediary stand-off markup designed to
               <q>bridge</q> different TEI markup ecosystems with each their own priorities
               for description and representation of the novel.
            </p>
            <p>Of course, to be <span class="ital">interoperable</span> is not the same thing
               as to be <span class="ital">interchangeable</span>. Syd Bauman’s definitive
               Balisage paper of 2011, <a href="https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol7/html/Bauman01/BalisageVol7-Bauman01.html" class="link" target="_new"><q>Interchange vs. Interoperability</q></a> is especially helpful in
               discussing and evaluating the different priorities represented by each term.
               Interoperability (or interoperationality) depends on whether a document can be processed
               by a computer program without human intervention. Interchangeability, on the other
               hand,
               involves human interpretation and is supported by community-defined vocabularies and
               well-written documentation. While TEI users often wish to prioritize ready
               interoperability, as in preparing <q>Lite</q> or <q>Simple</q> code
               easily interpretable by a software tool (say, a TEI plugin for a document viewer),
               Bauman finds that this is exceedingly difficult to achieve without sacrificing
               expressive semantics to the requirements of a software package. By contrast,
               interchangeable encoding, especially encoding that permits what Bauman calls
               <q>blind interchange</q>, prioritizes human legibility such that
               interpreting files does not require contacting the original encoder for help in
               understanding how the data was marked. Interchangeable data achieves semantic richness
               and lasting value without needing to predict the operating systems and software
               available to deliver it. It also does not require the forced simplification that
               interoperability demands for suiting what tools are or might become available.
            </p>
            <p>Bauman represents these goals as at odds with one another, stressing the point that
               interoperability is a matter of machine interpretation without human intervention:
               <q>interoperability and expressiveness are competing goals constantly in tension
                  with each other. While the analogy is far from exact, interoperationality is akin
                  to
                  equality, and expressiveness is akin to liberty.</q> The equality Bauman
               ascribes to interoperable would seem to raze the complexity of a project, levelling
               all
               projects to simple terms common to a convenient universal application. Perhaps, though,
               enhancing the interchangeability of documents could create better conditions for
               interoperation that do not sacrifice the complex ontologies and research questions
               of
               data-driven TEI markup. Much depends on how we conceive of machine interoperation,
               our
               awareness of the suitability (and limits) of the tools we apply, and the constructions
               we develop to <q>cross-pollinate</q> projects developed in distinct
               ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p>Traditionally, the TEI has cared about both ideals. As Elli Mylonas and Allen Renear
               discussed in 1999, TEI’s development of a language for data description and interchange
               helped to build and support an international research community with a tool for
               scholarship while also intervening in the <q>proliferation of systems for
                  representing textual material on computers. These systems were almost always
                  incompatible, often poorly designed, and growing in number at nearly the same rapid
                  rate as the electronic text projects themselves.</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e179" class="footnoteref" id="d1e179-ref">[2]</a></sup>. While promoting blind interchange, TEI projects support development of
               specialized tools for constructing digital editions in particular, and of course this
               is
               where we run amok with the interoperability challenge. Optimally developers who work
               with TEI approach software tools with the caveat that some customization might be
               necessary to adapt the tool to respond to the distinctiveness of the data rather than
               the other way around, and that puts us into experimental territory as
               <q>tinkerers</q> or refiners of tools.
            </p>
            <p>In the history of preparing digital texts with markup languages, whether in early
               HTML, SGML, or XML, markup standards tensed between two poles: 
               <div class="orderedlist" id="d1e192">

                     <li id="d1e193">
                        <p>the acknowledgement of a coexistence of multiple hierarchical structures,
                           and
                        </p>
                     </li>

                           conflicting hierarchies as of secondary importance.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e199" class="footnoteref" id="d1e199-ref">[3]</a></sup></p>

               </div> For us to write processes that <q>read around</q> conficting
               hierarchies, we require a third alternative that does not place coexistence in an
               oppositional camp, but rather prioritizes lateral intersections without sacrificing
               data
               curated in distinctly different structures. Makers of genetic editions (as for example
               <a href="http://beta.faustedition.net/" class="link" target="_new">the genetic Faust edition</a>)
               find ourselves in this intermediary third position, when multiple encoding structures
               must co-exist and correlate to achieve a meaningful comparison of editions.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e245" class="footnoteref" id="d1e245-ref">[4]</a></sup> To produce an intermediating structure, the original hierarchies need to be
               reconceived in dynamic terms. We need to question and observe, where are their flex
               points for conversion from containment structures to loci of intersection? That, of
               course, is a determination reliant on interchange, in support of
               interoperationality.

            <p>In the process of collation, hierarchies must be dismantled and flattened in order
               for
               meaningful multiplicity to be represented, and in order for us to understand a dialogic
               relationship among textual variants. To study variation over time vexes the organizing
               principle of any singular hierarchy, but for an alternative bridge-building
               architecture, arches and connecting spans are more viable than monoliths. Our use
               of the
               terms <q>arch</q>, <q>bridge</q>, or <q>span</q> is more than a
               metaphor here, but drawn from a graph-based model of text on which, not coincidentally,
               collateX was designed for locating variants in documents. <sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e268" class="footnoteref" id="d1e268-ref">[5]</a></sup></p>
            <p>We describe one such effort in the Frankenstein Variorum Project.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e283" class="footnoteref" id="d1e283-ref">[6]</a></sup>. Much of our work has involved preparing documents for processing with <a href="https://collatex.net" class="link" target="_new">CollateX</a> software, which automates the
               location of alignments and deltas in multiple versions of a text. We have had to contend
               a challenge of interchange to be able to make meaningful comparisons of digital editions
               made at different times by different editors, with a goal to prepare a digital variorum
               edition of five versions of Frankenstein in TEI. We first up-converted two of our
               collation source documents from the 1990s web 1.0 HTML encoding of the Pennsylvania
               Electronic Edition of <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span> for the 1818 and
               1831 editions<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e296" class="footnoteref" id="d1e296-ref">[7]</a></sup>. We needed to find a way to collate these editions with the Shelley-Godwin
               Archive’s diplomatic edition of the manuscript notebooks of 1816, the only known
               existing drafts of the novel.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e306" class="footnoteref" id="d1e306-ref">[8]</a></sup> We are also newly incorporating a little-known edition of the novel’s 1823
               publication produced from corrected OCR of a Google Books facsimile, together with
               transcription of Mary Shelley’s handwritten revision notes on a copy of the 1818
               publication known as <q>the Thomas copy</q> held at the Morgan Library and Museum.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e317" class="footnoteref" id="d1e317-ref">[9]</a></sup> Our collation should yield a meta-narrative of how <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span> changed over time in five versions that passed through
               multiple editorial hands. It is widely understood that the 1831 edition diverges sharply
               from the first print edition of 1818, adding new material and changing the relationships
               of characters. Less known is how the notebook material compares with the print editions,
               and how much we can identify of the persistence of various hands involved in composing,
               amending, and substantially revising the novel over the three editions. For example,
               to
               build on Charlie Robinson’s identification of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s hand in the
               notebooks, our collation can reveal how much of Percy’s insertions and deletions survive
               in the later print editions. Our work should permit us to survey when and how the
               major
               changes of the 1831 text (for example, to Victor Frankenstein’s family members and
               the
               compression and reduction of a chapter in part I) occurred. We preserve information
               about hands, insertions, and deletions in the output collation, to serve as the basis
               for better quantifying, characterizing, and surveying the contexts of collaboration
               and
               revision in textual scholarship.
            </p>
            <p>The three print editions and extant material from three manuscripts are compared in
               parallel, to indicate the presence of variants in the other texts and to be able to
               highlight them based on intensity of variance, to be displayed like the highlighted
               passages in each visible edition of <span class="ital">The Origin of

               comparison, we hold the collation information in stand-off markup, in its own XML
               hierarchy. That XML <q>bridge</q> expresses relationships among the distinct
               encodings of diplomatic manuscript markup in which the highest level of hierarchy
               is a
               unit leaf of the notebook, with the structural encoding of print editions organized
               in
               chapters, letters, and volumes. While the apparently nested structure of these divisions
               might seem the most meaningful way to model <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span>, these pose a challenge to textual scholarship in their own
               right. As Wendell Piez has discussed, <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span>’s
               overlapping hierarchies of framing letters and chapters have led to inconsistencies
               in
               the novel's print production. Piez deploys a non-hierarchical encoding of the novel
               on
               which he constructs an SVG modeling (in ordered XML syntax) of the overlap itself.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e354" class="footnoteref" id="d1e354-ref">[11]</a></sup> Our work with collation depends on a similar interdependency of structurally
               inconsistent encoding.

               </p>
               <p>In the first stage, we adapt the source code from the Shelley-Godwin Archive
                  (specialized TEI for the encoding of manuscript page surfaces) and from the
                  Pennsylvania Electronic Edition (PAEE) (HTML 1.0 from the mid 1990s marking
                  paragraphs and sectional headings) to create new forms of XML to carry predictable
                  markers to assist in alignment. These new, pre-collation editions are resequenced
                  (as when we move marginal annotations from the end of the XML document into their
                  marked places as they would be read in the manuscript notebook). The texts from the
                  PAEE are corrected against photofacsimiles of first publications of the novel in
                  1818 and 1831. They are also differently <q>chunked</q> than their source
                  texts, resizing the unit file so that each represents an equivalent portion small
                  enough to collate meaningfully and large enough that each document demonstrably
                  aligns with the others at its start and end points. We prepared 33 collation units
                  of the novel. XML matching the pre-collation format is prepared from OCR texts of
                  the 1823 edition. Building from the 1818 collation units, we add in encoded
                  transcriptions of Mary Shelley's hand-written edits on <q>the Thomas
                     copy</q> of the 1818 publication.
               </p>
               <p>Stage two weaves these surrogate editions together and transfers information from
                  tags that we want to preserve for the variorum. Interacting with the angle brackets
                  as patterned strings with Python, we mask several elements from the diplomatic code
                  of the manuscript notebooks so that they are not processed in terms of comparison
                  but are nevertheless output to preserve their distinct information. In CollateX’s
                  informationally-rich XML output, these tags render as flattened text with character
                  entities replacing angle brackets so as not to introduce overlap problems with its
                  critical apparatus.
               </p>
               <p>In Stage three, we work delicately with strings that represent flattened composite
                  of preserved tag information and representations of the text, using XSLT
                  string-manipulation functions to construct new XML and plain text (TSV or JSON)
                  files for stylometric and other analysis. We can then study term frequencies and,
                  for example, where the strings associated with Percy Shelley are repeated in the
                  later editions, and how many were preserved by 1831. We also build the <span class="ital">standoff Bridge</span> in TEI for the digital variorum with its
                  pointers to multiple editions, as modelled in Figure 1.

                           and the manuscript agree (yellow reading), the print edition of 1831
                           introduces new text (blue reading). The pointers are expressed according to
                           the TEI XPointer Schemes defined in Chapter 16 of the TEI Guidelines and are
                           subject to change.

               <p> This example shows how the stand-off collation identifies variant readings
                  between texts by grouping pointers as opposed to grouping strings of text according
                  to the parallel segmentation technique described in Chapter 12 of the TEI Guidelines.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e409" class="footnoteref" id="d1e409-ref">[12]</a></sup> The TEI offers a stand-off method for encoding variants, called
                  “double-end-point-attachment”, in which variants can be encoded separately from the
                  base text by specifying the start and end point of the lemma of which they are a
                  variant. This allows encoders to refer to overlapping areas on the base text, but
                  despite its flexibility, this method still requires choosing a base text to which
                  anchor variant readings. While choosing a lemma for each variant may be necessary
                  for a critical edition, it is not ideal for a variorum edition like ours that, by
                  design, does not choose a base text.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e415" class="footnoteref" id="d1e415-ref">[13]</a></sup> Our approach, therefore, simply identifies variance and groups readings
                  from multiple sources without conflating them into one document and with
                  accommodation of multiple hierarchies.

            </pre><p>The markup above prioritizes description of lines on a manuscript notebook page
                  surface, delineated in a zone element, and the line elements together with those
                  indicating insertions and deletions pose us an obstacle course if we wish to attempt
                  to compare this passage with its corresponding unit in the much simpler XML encoding
                  we prepared for the print publications. One significant problem that we needed to
                  solve is the way words break around the ends of lines in the notebooks. These are
                  given hyphens only when present in the manuscript and are otherwise unmarked.
                  Consider the challenge of comparing the sequential stream of text delineated in the
                  code block above with the corresponding passage in our XML encoding of the 1818
                  edition:

            accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected
            the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the
            lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered
            dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of
            the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed
              &lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_110" n="098"/&gt;hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its
            limbs.&lt;/p&gt;
...
      &lt;/xml&gt;
  </pre>
                  Note: the code above for the pre-collation version of the 1818 edition is not
                  written in TEI, but borrows its elements. This is an example of simple XML we
                  prepared specifically for the purpose of collation, reducing the documents to
                  concentrate on the <q>running stream</q> of text and its basic structural
                  divisions. Here the paragraph is the most basic structural division, and chapter
                  boundaries are signalled with milestone markers.
               </p>
               <p>The act of reconciling these markup ecosystems required altering the structure of
                  the S-GA markup, to produce it in an alternative pre-collation <q>bridge</q>
                  format that matches up with elements in the encoding of the published editions,
                  which in this paper we will simply call <q>1818-style</q>). In the S-GA
                  markup the hierarchy is not especially deep, or it only becomes deep in describing
                  revision activities and changes of hand. These hierarchical structures do not
                  correspond with anything in the markup of the print-published editions, where
                  hierarchical depth comes from chapter, letter, and volume divisions. To make a
                  collatable <q>bridge</q> format required alteration of each (S-GA and
                  1818-style) to

                  </div> To build the <q>pre-collation bridge formats</q>, we needed
                  to flatten deep hierarchical structures from the <q>1818-style</q> XML
                  documents by converting them into milestone-style signals. We want to retain the
                  information about structural divisions, that is, paragraph, chapter, letter, and
                  volume boundaries, and include this as data, since changes in paragraphing or
                  chapter content are relevant to the variorum comparison of the Frankenstein
                  editions. However, we also retain markup which does not designate the running
                  sequence of text and basic text structure, but offers metadata about who wrote what,
                  and whether the writing was inserted or deleted. This allows us to reconcile
                  hierarchies that are otherwise completely at odds and nevertheless preserve their
                  information, though we need to do another round of work to screen some of that
                  information away from the collation process. Below is the sample passage from the
                  Shelley-Godwin Notebooks rendered in our bridge format, designed to be comparable
                  laterally with corresponding encoding in the 1818-style that we represented in the

         &lt;lb n="c56-0045__main__10"/&gt;dismally against the window panes, &amp; 
         &lt;lb n="c56-0045__main__11"/&gt;my candle was nearly burnt out, when

        </pre>
                  Notice what has changed here: We not only had to flatten <code class="code">&lt;line&gt;</code>
                  elements into self-closing <code class="code">&lt;lb/&gt;</code> signals but we needed to
                  actively insert <code class="code">&lt;word&gt;</code> elements to unite whole words broken
                  around the notebook lines. We also added locational <q>flags</q> or
                  <q>signal beacons</q> as the attribute on <code class="code">&lt;lb
                     n="*"/&gt;</code>, to assist us on the other side of the collation with generating
                  XML pointers back to the source text: these indicate positional zones and lines on
                  the notebook page surfaces, so that when output that data can be kept with its
                  associated collation units. In these information-enriching activities, of course,
                  we
                  are doing the human work required of interchange, and we do so in the interests of
                  interoperability, so the automated collation process can locate the same word tokens
                  without interference.
               </p>
               <p> The <q>pre-collation bridge format</q> needs to retain certain marked
                  metadata from the original TEI, including for example, whose hands are at work on
                  the manuscript at a given moment, so we can attempt to see if a string of text
                  inserted by Percy Bysshe Shelley continues to be supported in the later print
                  publications. However, such metadata needs to be masked from the collation process
                  so that we are not folding it into comparison of the running streams of text that
                  compose each version of the novel. To deliver these <q>pre-collation
                     bridge</q> XML files to collateX and instruct the software collation
                  algorithm on how to process them, <span class="ital">with</span> and
                  <span class="ital">around</span> their markup, we wrote a Python script
                  working with its xml.dom.pulldom tool, which parses XML documents as a running
                  stream of text and instructs the collation process to ignore some patterns
                  surrounded by angle brackets, while actively collating the others.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e506" class="footnoteref" id="d1e506-ref">[14]</a></sup>
                  
               </p>
               <p>In turn, the XML output generated by collateX itself serves as an intermediary
                  format, not in TEI, but containing its components in the form of critical apparatus
                  tagging, to hold information about the deltas of variance among the editions. The
                  output in XML flattens the tags we submitted into angle brackets and text, and the
                  shallow XML hierarchy holds only critical apparatus markup: <code class="code">&lt;app&gt;</code>
                  and its children <code class="code">&lt;rdg&gt;</code> to mark divergent branches. The complexity
                  of the code is such that perhaps it is for nearly illegible to human eyes and might
                  best be rendered in a screen capture for our purposes. Here is a view of the
                  collation output for the sample portion of <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span> we have been representing: 
                  <div class="mediaobject"><img alt="png image (Bal2018collateOutput042908.png)" src="Bal2018collateOutput042908.png"></div>
               </p>
               <p>While it may be difficult for humans to read, this code is information-rich and tractable
                  for the next stage of work in building up the Variorum, and due to its simple regularity
                  with embedded complexity, we might consider it to be a successful interchange format
                  in its own right. WE write XSLT to pull from this <q>pre-TEI</q> output from the collation process, and build the more legible and interoperable TEI
                  <q>spinal column</q> of our Variorum
                  edition. The edition architecture applies stand-off pointers in a form of <q>stand-off parallel segmentation</q>, which enhances the
                  available models in the TEI Guidelines for stand-off collation, while supporting the
                  TEI’s
                  longstanding interests in both interchange and interoperability, as we discuss below.
                  We want to promote
                  the long-term sustenance of digital editions by actively building bridges to render
                  isolated monumental projects interchangeable rather than remake them from the ground
                  up. Building ramps for interchangeability is an investment in interoperability as
                  well, specifically for producing the comparative views afforded by collation.
               </p>
               <p>Though we think of XML as a stable sustainable archiving medium, the repeated
                  collapsing and expansion of hierarchies in our collation process makes us consider
                  that for the viability of digital textual scholarship, ordered hierarchies of
                  content objects might best be designed with leveling in mind, and that building with
                  XML may be optimized when it is open to transformation. Preparing diversely encoded
                  documents for collation challenges us to consider inconsistent and overlapping
                  hierarchies as a tractable matter for computational alignment—where alignment
                  becomes an organizing principle that fractures hierarchies, chunking if not
                  atomizing them at the level of the smallest meaningfully sharable semantic
                  features.

            <p></p>
            <p>Generating the stand-off parallel segmentation requires processing and manipulating
               our multiple versions of TEI-encoded <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span> to
               locate the <q>addresses</q> of each varying point. This document is not,
               however, the end of the story: the bridges that it establishes are there to be crossed.
               Crossing the bridges, that is, following the pointers is not always trivial. Serious
               reasons for the somewhat limited use of stand-off in TEI include the limited support
               for
               resolving XPath, as well as the risk of not finding what was expected at the other
               end
               because of <q>link rot</q>, or because the target file was – even minimally –
               changed. In creating our stand-off collation, we tried to keep pointers as simple
               as
               possible by favoring locations expressed with XPath 1.0 over locations with string
               ranges (although the latter are unavoidable on multiple occasions). Finally, we made
               use
               of GitHub’s ability to obtain URLs to specific versions of files, which means that
               the
               files we point to are guaranteed not to change unexpectedly (although the URL itslef
               may
               <q>rot</q> and return a 404, eventually)<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e562" class="footnoteref" id="d1e562-ref">[15]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p>Having taken these precautions, our primary goal is building a web-based interactive
               variorum edition that readers can use to explore each version of the text. For example,
               one could start by reading the 1818 version of the novel; highlighted text would
               indicate the presence of a variant from another version and by clicking on it, the
               site
               visitor would be able to 
               <div class="orderedlist" id="d1e570">
                  <ol start="NaN" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                     <li id="d1e571">
                        <p>choose which variant readings they wish to read and compare, and</p>
                     </li>
                     <li id="d1e574">
                        <p>change their current view and pivot to a different text or grouping of
                           texts.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ol>
               </div>The software building this view follows links from the stand-off parallel
               segmentation to highlight text and retrieve bits of text from the other documents
               to be
               shown at he right place. This mode of publication adheres to well-established user
               experiences for digital editions; the fundamental difference, however, is in the
               integrity of each source document: the stand-off collation allows us to show where
               the
               differences are, and to retrieve them without having to modify or control the source
               documents. One can imagine an even more distributed application of this paradigm,
               where
               the pointers target TEI documents not owned by the project that does the pointing.
               Working with Shelley-Godwin Archive (S-GA) documents was a first experiment in this
               direction. Even though S-GA staff is directly involved in this project, we have made
               it
               a cornerstone of our experiment to not modify S-GA files (except the occasional typo
               or
               minor contribution that was sent back via a GitHub Pull Request); in short, we treated
               S-GA as an external project that we can point to but not change.
            </p>
            <p>Publishing the variorum is but one path that can be taken across the bridges of our
               collation. As we mentioned earlier, we kept in mind the richness of S-GA TEI documents,
               particularly regarding authorship (who wrote what) and authorial revisions. In order
               to
               follow a pointer to an S-GA document, we must process the full document; while it
               may
               seem counter-intuitive, this is an advantage because we gain access to the full context
               of the text we addresses.
               
               This would allow us, for example, to determine and indicate in the user interface
               whether a variant reading was part of a revision by Percy Shelley, or allows us to
               perform larger scale operations to track such phenomena, which could then be plotted
               as
               visualizations.

                  1818 publication containing her handwritten insertions, deletions, and comments
                  with her friend Mrs. Thomas before leaving Italy for England in 1823, following
                  Percy Shelley’s death in Lerici. The edits may have been entered at any time
                  between 1818 and 1823, and they are of interest because they indicate at an
                  early stage that Mary Shelley wanted to alter many passages in her novel, and
                  was continuing to experiment with the characterization of Victor and the
                  Creature. But they also indicate a point of divergence, since she did not have
                  access to these edits in revising the novel for its 1831 publication. A key
                  motivation for collating these editions is to attempt to compare the novel as it
                  was being revised soon after its first publication (whose bicentennial we
                  celebrate in 2018) with its later incarnation in the traditionally widely read
                  1831 edition. Another is discovering just how different the 1816 draft notebooks
                  are from the later texts. Scholars over the past forty years have oscillated
                  between the 1831 and 1818 editions as the <q>preferred</q> texts, but
                  there is really no single canonical version of this novel, and for that reason
                  our Variorum edition does not indicate a standard <q>base text</q>,
                  which is still unusual in representing scholarly editions.
