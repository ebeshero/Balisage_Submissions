                                                  intensive</q> experience for university students? Having taught students with a range of majors from humanities to computer science to
                           
                           build web-based research projects with the the XML family of languages, the author is developing a
                           Text Encoding Fundamentals course with emphasis on text encoding as writing, as well
                                           as a proposal that this fulfill a major state university requirement of a
                                           research-oriented <q>writing intensive</q> course for
                                           undergraduate students to fulfill a requirement in <q>writing across the curriculum</q>. 
                                           While we may be familiar with arguments that coding and
                                           programming are a kind of literacy, the idea that developing projects with markup
                                           technologies may constitute an <span class="ital">intensive</span> writing experience is
                                           less familiar. The consideration of text encoding as writing intensive may establish
                                           a call for teaching markup technologies more widely in a cross-disciplinary
                                           context.
                        </p>
                        <p>Not just any course introducing students to markup should be considered writing
                                           intensive. Arguably, a class that involves tagging exercises without project
                                           development and invites students to write reflectively about the experience is not
                                           engaging in an <span class="ital">intensive</span> way with the writing work we associate
                                           with coding in a project development context. This paper argues that a
                                               <span class="ital">writing intensive</span> course involving the XML family of languages should engage a writing process that requires research
                                           and citation, algorithmic problem-solving and decision making, task management, and
                                           documentation to share the work and help others to build upon it. A course offering
                                           such experiences should be accessible to students from several
                                           disciplines, whether to a junior year English or history major with little to no
                                           programming experience, or a junior year computer science or information technology
                                           major with an interest in applied programming, unused to research questions that
                                           drive humanities scholarship. In presenting its case, this paper explores a range of
                                           literature to locate intersections between digital writing modalities discussed in
                                           the context of composition courses and the concept of literate programming that
                                           grounds the XML family of languages.

                                    foundation for literacy in the twenty-first century. Learning to write programming code
                                    engages a student in writing commands, conditional expressions, and descriptive
                                    annotation as well as metacommentary in documentation. For the distinctly imperative
                                    aspects of coding, Annette Vee finds parallels in Kenneth Burke&#8217;s speech-act theory of
                                    human expression as performative, to move an audience to process ideas in response to a
                                    scripted delivery, whether that audience is human or machine, and she calls for greater
                                    awareness of the intersection of scripting that connects the writing and coding process.

                                    makes the material more widely accessible and <q>could help a broader group of kids

                                    learn a science enacts a return to an earlier and more integrated approach to education,
                                    before the <q>sciences</q> had become formally distinct from
                                        <q>humanities</q>: the late eighteenth century saw the scientific poems of
                                    Erasmus Darwin and calls for poetry that would bring zoology and botany to life and
                                    encourage sympathy with the natural world.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e305" class="footnoteref" id="d0e305-ref">[12]</a></sup> We have known that the act of writing enhances learning in across
                                    disciplines for a long time now. But futher, as Hermans and Alderweld point out,
                                    students can learn programming more easily if they are taught in the mode of writing
                                    instruction, with modeled examples and activities that hone observation skills. What
                                    might this mean for learning to work with XML? It might involve students reviewing
                                    markup, schemas, interfaces, and visualizations from established XML projects as part of
                                    their course experience, and writing about how they observe things to be working. For
                                    example, students can be given assignments to explore a project site like the <a href="https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/index.htm" class="link" target="_new">Map
                                           of Early Modern London</a> or the <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/" class="link" target="_new">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a> to look at the code

                                    together. In exploring sites like these, students in the author&#8217;s classes have often found a basis for
                                    understanding what kinds of research questions and web reading and research tools their
                                    encoding and programming work can make possible, and they often build on what they learn in their own projects
                        to understand how they can organize information about people, places, contexts, language patterns, revision history, and more.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e324" class="footnoteref" id="d0e324-ref">[13]</a></sup></p>
                     <p>It is probably no coincidence that Donald Knuth modeled his concept of <q>literate
                                           programming</q> with programming for document formatting in the 1980s. In this
                                    context the programming of a machine to format electronic documents unites fundamentally
                                    with the action and reproduction of writing. Knuth&#8217;s now-familiar concept seems simple
                                    in hindsight: <q>Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer
                                           what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a

                        </div> Literate programming is part of the XML specifications and became
                                    paradigmatic for the the XML family of languages by the turn of the new millenium. In
                                    2002 Norm Walsh modeled its application to the DocBook XSLT stylesheets by applying
                                    namespaces to permit the tangling of actionable code with documentation.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e369" class="footnoteref" id="d0e369-ref">[16]</a></sup>. Responding to Walsh&#8217;s work, Eric van der Vlist prepared a clear and
                                    thoroughly-documented explanation how literate programming applies to developing schema
                                    rules for project coding through XML with embedded Relax NG code, readily transformable
                                    into multiple formats to produce schema validation checking as well as human-readable

                                    One-Document-Does-It-All (ODD) system has modeled literate programming for the purpose
                                    of compiling and delivering the Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) as a
                                    combination of documentation and processing code instantiating the schema rules of the

                        family of languages should be
                                    understood as thoroughly writerly.
                     </p>
                     <p>Student coders can gain an introductory experience in literate programming in
                                    designing ODD schemas with descriptive glosses and explanation encoded together with
                                    schema rules in project. Whether or not we understand the drafting of an ODD
                                    customization to constitute an experience in embedded programming, we can recognize its
                                    value for writing intensive literacy, because it involves students writing the rules for
                                    a project to work systematically and designing its data for consistency and precision,
                                    and it provides for description and explanation that can make a project sharable with
                                    others. Markup, documentation and programming work in the development of XML-based
                                    projects should be promoted within educational institutions as a distinctly intensive
                                    experience of writing applied to build resources soundly and well.

                     <p>The aspect of XML encoding that makes it so problematic or impossible for
                                    interoperational processing (even within a shared vocabulary like the TEI) is the
                                    semantic naming of tags, what Desmond Schmidt has called its

                                    makes it writerly and scholarly in nature, and gives it power as a research tool, a power that is enhanced when
                                    new coders learn not just how to tag but also how to manage and process their
                                    tagging as a controlled system. Confronting the challenge of processing the markup and
                                    sharing it with others outside one&#8217;s discourse community (oneself, one&#8217;s team, or one&#8217;s
                                    semester class) is what this section designates as <span class="ital">intensive</span> about
                                    a course in writing with markup. An introductory writing experience with markup
                                    languages may familiarize students with the data structure and well-formedness and some
                                    of the issues of transformation and sharing the data, but intensification of the writing
                                    challenge begins with confronting the management issues of writing a customization and
                                    designing schema validation rules. Still more intensification is applied when students
                                    learn how they can navigate and process the markup data.
                     </p>
                     <p>This issue with writerly nature of XML coding and processing is not well appreciated
                                    in the larger context of digital humanities work or among professional developers eager to facilitate the publication
                        process and separate it from the markup practice. Coders can produce complicated, even intricate
                                    structures with XML and TEI and give impatient developers headaches, but we would do well to encounter
                                    those structures as building materials the way writers do and give our students the
                                    tools to work with them. Rather than designing projects primarily to suit the needs of
                                    developers or content management systems, markup practitioners can learn the writing
                                    intensive way to control the developing tools as their writing instruments. There will
                                    be a time and place for the content management system optimized for interoperation, but
                                    this should not be the only way that students and scholars learn to write with
                                    markup.
                     </p>
                     <p>A course in text encoding could take a concentration within a
                                    discipline like English Literature, as Kate Singer&#8217;s class at Mount Holyoke did, to
                                    concentrate collectively on constructing a digital edition of a collection of poems.
                                    Singer found that the <q>broad-based &#8216;humanities language&#8217; of the TEI enabled
                                           students to question, historicize, and reconsider the poetic terminology we use to
                                           describe poems</q>. She and her students found that the controlled vocabulary of
                                    the TEI, in prioritizing larger patterns of structure while permitting customization to
                                    the encoder of historically constructed and shifting categories of poetic genre, left
                                    room for a community of scholars to rethink form or apply the old constructions as they
                                    saw fit. In the context of a course, that work can be excitingly experimental. The
                                    pedagogical benefit of engaging students in markup and its applications was to foster
                                    decision-making, documentation, and design thinking, as Singer found her students eager
                                    to take on design decisions for customizing their own interface for their edition. Not
                                    only did they benefit by gaining tech skills, but they also became more observant
                                    readers of poetry as well as the interfaces and infrastructures of larger-scale digital
                                    scholarly editions they encountered. <q>This kind of interpretive markup may,
                                           finally, give us some inkling of how TEI might be used as an analytical tool for
                                           smaller-scale, case-based projects perfect for undergraduates as they learn to parse
                                           and categorize their own textual situations.</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e444" class="footnoteref" id="d0e444-ref">[20]</a></sup>. Courses like these prioritize the intellectual engagement of a class with
                                    the document objects they are investigating, and here the markup is clearly a research
                                    and investigation tool. Fitting the students' markup to an externally imposed uniform publication framework would
                        have made the work less messy and easier to publish, but would have stifled the students' experimentation and removed them
                        from the intellectual decision-making process of doing their own project development. Even unfinished work in the course of
                        a short semester is a stepping stone to renewed engagement in a process of structured work with document data modeling, querying,
                        checking, testing, and transforming to share their work.
                     </p>
                     <p>The XML family of languages were designed not only to be widely accessible, but also
                                    to be a vocabulary that the writer controls, consults, remixes, and transforms. It does
                                    not take very long to acquaint new coders to the rules of how to tag a document, or how
                                    to turn a <q>plain text</q> document into an XML document, though often people
                                    experience a little frustration with typing in the attributes or figuring what they can
                                    do with attributes. The first week or two of a class that involves markup methods can
                                    orient people to the basic rules of well-formedness, but that quickly introduces an
                                    engaging intellectual experience when we ask students to develop their own hierarchies
                                    to organize what they are reading, and when we invite our students to try to recognize
                                    what is implicit, and find ways to use elements, attributes, or comments to make that
                                    explicit. The act of inscribing markup has been recognized as a writing process, but if
                                    it goes no further than an exercise in tagging, perhaps we should consider this
                                    something like writing a reflective paper, a response that sharpens one&#8217;s observation
                                    and critical thinking skills.

                                           Often new coders introduce far more differently named elements than they really need, or
                                           that would be baffling to keep track of in a real-life project. To understand how to code helpfully and meaningfully,
                           a student needs to confront the
                                           problem of sharing and reproducibility. Being able to share a decision process and a set of rules for an XML
                           project to describe its work is similar to the awareness of an audience

                        <p>The road to improvement can be based on the same principles of understanding how
                                           to convey relationships, and how to prioritize a main idea with a subordinate
                                           clause. A student might write a paragraph like the following in a draft that could
                                           benefit from some rounds of revision: 
                           <div class="blockquote">

                                 <p>Historically, women have had a tough time when it comes to writing novels
                                                            and combatting prejudices and sexism. Many female authors have had to
                                                            publish their novels with a male pseudonym or as an anonymous author. When
                                                            writing <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span>, Mary shelley wrote it
                                                            among her friends to see who could write the best horror story and she did
                                                            not tag it with her name. The famous story was left anonymous so her friends
                                                            wouldn't have a prejudice view when reading it. The story ended up being her
                                                            most famous book and she was a female writer, who wrote a horror story about
                                                            a male creator and a frightening, male creature.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e475" class="footnoteref" id="d0e475-ref">[21]</a></sup>

                           </div>Instructors who teach writing courses understand the complexities of
                                           advising a student on how to revise writing like this. We often comment that the
                                           students' ideas are <q>good</q> or <q>interesting</q>, but we need a
                                           stronger sense of how the ideas connect, and every sentence needs to support a
                                           single central idea, in this case about how Mary Shelley, like other women authors
                                           in English history, opted to conceal a female identity in publishing her work.
                                           Beyond simple misspellings and missed capitalization, we can identify conceptual
                                           problems of subordination, especially evident in the last sentence where the fame of
                                           the book and the female identiy of the writer are placed at the same main idea
                                           level, out of chronological sequence. The ordering of ideas and the decision of
                                           where to place subordinate clauses is a problem we can associate with organization
                                           or hierarchy. Rewriting such a paragraph sometimes involves reorganizing and
                                           condensing, pulling together apparently disconnected parts in the first draft. For
                                           example, here is my own attempt to rewrite the student&#8217;s paragraph: 
                           <div class="blockquote">
                              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                                 <p>Historically, many women authors faced a sexist and prejudiced publishing
                                                            industry and opted to conceal their identities either by publishing with a
                                                            male pseudonym or anonymously, as Mary Shelley did with the anonymous first
                                                            publication of <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span> in 1818. The
                                                            novel, a horror story about a male creator and a frightening male creature,
                                                            became her most famous work, and eventually was published with her name on
                                                            the title page.

                           </div> My suggested rewriting of this seems a little unsatisfactory because I
                                           sense here is something the student might have developed, a sort of loose end from
                                           the draft, something about the idea of a female author writing about a male
                                           scientist creator and a male creature, whose violent conflict drives this book.
                                           Would she have wanted to explore that issue of a woman author investigating male
                                           conflict? Is that perhaps the topic of another essay entirely? Writing and rewriting
                                           can impose order but also cut out possible avenues of development.
                        </p>
                        <p>I can find similar examples that demonstrate issues with subordination in
                                           students&#8217; first XML encoding efforts. In my roughly seven consecutive years of
                                           teaching undergraduates to code with the XML family of languages, I notice a
                                           recurring pattern in the first three of weeks of a semester that some students have
                                           difficulties with conceptualizing dependencies, much like the issues we identified
                                           in the student paragraph about Mary Shelley. Students just starting to code often
                                           prepare shallow hierarchies, and instead of bundling list items together into a
                                           wrapped cluster, they make a very flat tree where every line is its own entry. These
                                           students benefit from seeing examples of nested markup, and also from understanding
                                           something about how the markup may be processed to work out how attributes can be
                                           used to disambiguate or categorize to refine the markup. For that reason, I have
                                           found that inviting my students to write their first markup on a recipe, one that
                                           contains an interesting variety of ingredients, measurement units, and activities,
                                           provides a very clear and easily recognizable sense of structure with lots of
                                           categories of information. I ask students to envision a scenario for the encoding
                                           that tries to create a system for filing documents: 
                           <div class="blockquote">
                              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                                 <p>First, read this recipe for homemade bread, and pretend you are filing it
                                                            with hundreds of other recipes that you need to fit a set purpose, such as
                                                            running a restaurant, in which you need to keep track of kinds and
                                                            quantities of ingredients required. XML is written to store information, and
                                                            when we apply it to a situation with numbers and units, like with coding
                                                            recipes, the code we write can help make computerized calculations, and help
                                                            optimize searching across a collection for particular kinds of ingredients.
                                                            Your code might be designed to help categorize ingredients by what part of
                                                            the grocery store they can be found in. The challenge of the assignment is
                                                            to write code that helps categorize ingredients, mark necessary equipment,
                                                            and stages for processing, but the system you develop is up to you.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e498" class="footnoteref" id="d0e498-ref">[22]</a></sup></p>

                           </div> It is fascinating to see the variety of encodings students submit for
                                           this assignment, with no two being much alike. With a few exceptions the students
                                           usually are able to submit well-formed XML by day 2 of the course, but they
                                           sometimes don't quite understand the concept of nesting structures or demonstrating
                                           relationships, as for example this tagging of the ingredients list of a sourdough
                                           recipe.

            </pre>
                                           Here we see a common problem for new learners of XML: thinking that white space is
                                           sufficient to relate like to like, rather than recognizing the need to position
                                           wrapper elements. The student has not quite understood that the
                                               <code class="code">&lt;measurement&gt;</code> and <code class="code">&lt;amount&gt;</code> elements are
                                           not really associated together. Nor has the student tried to apply attributes, yet,
                                           but they have ventured an XML comment about ingredient substitution. The code is
                                           promising for its regularity and consistency, but lacks an understanding of how to
                                           work with the XML tree hierarchy. Another student seems to have a stronger grasp on
                                           the assignment, but even here we can find some issues that relate to writing
                                           problems of redundancy or overreliance on a particular word, here the attribute
                                               <code class="code">@type</code> being overused:

    &lt;step n="6"&gt;Stretch one edge of the dough (still in the bowl), then press it into the center of
        the bowl. Repeat this about a dozen times, moving clockwise to catch all sides of the

        over so the seams are on the bottom&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step n="8"&gt;Cover and let rest for &lt;time&gt;20

        times, with &lt;time&gt;20-minute&lt;/time&gt; rests after each&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step n="10"&gt;Cover and
        refrigerate &lt;time&gt;at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/step&gt;. The dough should have
    doubled. If it hasn't, leave it on the counter until it does. &lt;step n="11"&gt;Lightly flour a work
        surface&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step n="12"&gt;Use a &lt;equipment type="cloth"&gt;pastry cloth&lt;/equipment&gt; or clean
            &lt;equipment type="cloth"&gt;dish towel&lt;/equipment&gt; to line a round &lt;equipment
            type="bakeware"&gt;colander&lt;/equipment&gt;. Dust the cloth with flour&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step n="13"
        &gt;Transfer the dough to the floured work surface. Fold the edges toward the center to create
        a round shape, turning it over so the seams are on the bottom&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step n="14"&gt;Let it
        rest for &lt;time&gt;5 minutes&lt;/time&gt;, then transfer to the colander, seam side up&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step
        n="15"&gt;Cover with a &lt;equipment type="cloth"&gt;towel&lt;/equipment&gt; and let the dough rise for
            &lt;time&gt;1 1/2 hours&lt;/time&gt;.&lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;step n="16"&gt;&lt;time&gt;Thirty minutes before baking&lt;/time&gt;, place a &lt;equipment type="bakeware"
            &gt;cast-iron Dutch oven (lid on)&lt;/equipment&gt; or &lt;equipment type="bakeware"&gt;enameled
            cast-iron pot with a lid (on)&lt;/equipment&gt; in the oven; preheat to &lt;temp&gt;475
            degrees&lt;/temp&gt;&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step n="17"&gt;Carefully remove the hot pot from the oven.&lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;step n="18"&gt;Turn the dough out onto the counter so the seams are on the bottom&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step
        n="19"&gt;Use &lt;equipment type="utensil"&gt;kitchen scissors&lt;/equipment&gt; to make 8 snips on the top
        of the dough in an evenly spaced spoke pattern, each about 1/4-inch deep&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step
        n="20"&gt;Lift the dough and carefully drop it into the hot pot. Immediately cover with the hot
        lid&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step n="21"&gt;Bake for &lt;time&gt;30 minutes&lt;/time&gt;, then reduce the heat to &lt;temp&gt;450
            degrees&lt;/temp&gt;&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;step n="22"&gt;Uncover and bake for &lt;time&gt;8 to 10 minutes&lt;/time&gt; or
        until the crust is dark brown&lt;/step&gt;. Try to minimize the amount of time the oven door is
    open. The bread is done when its internal temperature registers &lt;temp&gt;205 degrees&lt;/temp&gt; on an
        &lt;equipment type="utensil"&gt;instant-read thermometer&lt;/equipment&gt; and the loaf sounds hollow
    when knocked on the underside. &lt;step n="23"&gt;Transfer the loaf to a &lt;equipment type="bakeware"
            &gt;wire rack&lt;/equipment&gt; to cool for at least &lt;time&gt;1 hour&lt;/time&gt; before cutting&lt;/step&gt;. &lt;/recipe&gt;  
                </pre>
                                           The nested <code class="code">&lt;measurement&gt;</code> elements inside <code class="code">&lt;measurement&gt;</code> elements are probably taking the
                                           hierarchy a little too far, but offer a good opportunity to discuss how to handle
                                           equivalent units (grams to cups), perhaps by encoding that information in attribute
                                           values, and reconsidering the representation of fractions. If the code is going to
                                           be processed by a computer to, say triple this recipe, how would it be best to
                                           represent the numerical quantities and conversion factors? What is remarkable here
                                           for an early XML assignment is the student decision to mark types of equipment
                                           within the steps. The student could reconsider the variety of attributes, but the
                                           effort to track categories of measurement as well as categories of ingredient (wet
                                           vs. dry) is admirable on a first experience with angle brackets. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Even when a student quickly learns how to apply hierarchies, they are, of course,
                                           prone to inconsistencies like these before they learn to write schema validation
                                           code:
                                           <pre class="programlisting">
                 &lt;step n="9"&gt;&lt;process type="action"&gt;Lightly flour&lt;/process&gt; a &lt;item type="equimpent"&gt;work
            surface.&lt;/item&gt; Use a &lt;item type="equipment"&gt;pastry cloth&lt;/item&gt; or &lt;item
            type="equipment"&gt;clean dish towel&lt;/item&gt; to &lt;process type="action"&gt;line a &lt;item
                type="equipment"&gt;&lt;adj type="equipment"&gt;round&lt;/adj&gt; colander&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/process&gt;.&lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;step n="10"&gt;&lt;process type="action"&gt;Dust&lt;/process&gt; the &lt;item type="equipment"&gt;cloth&lt;/item&gt; with
            &lt;item type="ingredient"&gt;flour&lt;/item&gt;.&lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;step n="11"&gt;&lt;process type="action"&gt;Transfer&lt;/process&gt; the &lt;item type="ingredient"&gt;dough&lt;/item&gt;
        to the &lt;adj type="equipment"&gt;floured&lt;/adj&gt;
        &lt;item type="equipment"&gt;work surface&lt;/item&gt;.&lt;/step&gt;
            </pre>
                                           This student reveled in coming up with complex hierarchies in his first week of
                                           coding, but a typo means that his attribute values are inconsistently marked. Such
                                           precision might pass unnoticed as a relatively harmless error in a student essay,
                                           but here it becomes an opportunity to introduce the power of schema writing to
                                           students, to write their own spell checkers for their attribute values and control
                                           which elements and attributes are permitted to appear at each level of the
                                           hierarchy. </p>
                        <p>In the first week of my class, students usually move from encoding a recipe to
                                           encoding a poem or a piece of historical correspondence. Changing to code a
                                           different genre of document can lead students to recognize different kinds of data
                                           and observations about the formal dimensions and organization of patterns, as well
                                           as the interest in referencing different kinds of information like names, dates,
                                           people, and places, as well as images, motifs, rhyme. Quite frequently student
                                           beginners will take the text content of a document and repeat it in an attribute
                                           value, as for example wrapping code around a name as given in a text, and using that
                                           name in an attribute value on the element, until they receive some suggestions that
                                           they might want to use the attribute as a key for a standard identifier whenever
                                           this individual is mentioned by their various names. Students who have difficulty
                                           constructing dependent clauses may find the preparation of an informative,
                                           non-redundant hierarchy just as challenging as their composition courses, and while
                                           their first efforts are observably messy, they can be discussed in terms of how to
                                           simplify if one were to prepare a large collection and wanted to work systematically
                                           with a particularly interesting and tractable kind of data.

                        <p>Students often improve their markup dramatically when they learn to write Relax NG
                                           schema code that creates rules for encoding. This may be a first data-modeling
                                           experience for students in a general education context, when they are called upon to
                                           think in a <q>meta</q> or higher order reflective way about formalizing their
                                           code, and making it possible for others to understand it and reproduce it. Learning to
                                           write schema code also leads to writing
                                           comments to explain decisions and document the code. The following example pairs a short coded document with
                           a student&#8217;s schema, and a conversation with another student who was reviewing the code and offering advice. First, here is
                           the XML the student prepared with some good-natured snark from my own assignment instructions:
                                           <pre class="programlisting">
                   &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-model href="01-22_SCHEMA_rngEx02.rnc" type="application/relax-ng-compact-syntax"?&gt;
&lt;root&gt;
    &lt;intro&gt; Make sure you do the following: &lt;/intro&gt;
    &lt;step num="1"&gt; 1) &lt;act type="spec"&gt;Save&lt;/act&gt; your &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;Relax NG file&lt;/obj&gt;
        &lt;desc type="rel"&gt;with the &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;.rnc extension&lt;/obj&gt; at the &lt;obj type="conc"
                &gt;end&lt;/obj&gt;&lt;/desc&gt; and &lt;act type="unspec"&gt;work with it&lt;/act&gt; in the &lt;desc type="adj"
            &gt;same&lt;/desc&gt;
        &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;file directory&lt;/obj&gt;
        &lt;desc type="rel"&gt;with your &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;.xml file&lt;/obj&gt;.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;step num="2"&gt; 2) &lt;act type="spec"&gt;Associate&lt;/act&gt; your &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;.rnc schema&lt;/obj&gt;
        &lt;desc type="rel"&gt;with your &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;.xml file.&lt;/obj&gt;&lt;/desc&gt;
        &lt;exp&gt;(You are &lt;desc type="rel"&gt;finished&lt;/desc&gt; with this &lt;obj type="conc"&gt;exercise&lt;/obj&gt; if
            your &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;XML&lt;/obj&gt; is &lt;desc type="rel"&gt;&lt;act type="spec"&gt;associated&lt;/act&gt;
                with your schema&lt;/desc&gt; and &lt;desc type="adj"&gt;both&lt;/desc&gt;
            &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;files&lt;/obj&gt; have &lt;act type="spec"&gt;come out&lt;/act&gt;
            &lt;desc type="adj"&gt;"green"&lt;/desc&gt; in &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;oXygen&lt;/obj&gt;.)&lt;/exp&gt;
    &lt;/step&gt;
    &lt;step num="3"&gt; 3) &lt;act type="spec"&gt;Upload&lt;/act&gt;
        &lt;desc type="adj"&gt;BOTH&lt;/desc&gt;
        &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;files&lt;/obj&gt; here. We &lt;act type="unspec"&gt;need to see&lt;/act&gt; your &lt;desc
            type="rel"&gt;&lt;obj type="comp"&gt;.xml file&lt;/obj&gt; and your &lt;obj type="comp"&gt;.rnc
            file&lt;/obj&gt;.&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;/step&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;!-- bb_1/22/20: I wanted to keep it simple for once, so I literally used the assignment as a text. Sue me.--&gt; 
                </pre>
                                           Here is the Relax NG schema in compact syntax, where a new pattern of writing extensive commentary is emerging
                           in the student (whose initials are bb). The peer-reviewing student is amp, who had learned to write schemas and design projects
                           in a previous semester: 
                                           <pre class="programlisting">
                  datatypes xsd = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"
start = root

#bb_1/22/20: root is the root element
root = element root{intro, step+}

#bb_1/22/20: step is one of our 'highest' content objects on the hierarchy
step = element step{num, (exp|act|obj|desc|text)+}
#amp: This would be better as mixed content! (We've already touched on this in class, but I'll leave a note here as well) So, it would look like this: step = element step{num, mixed{exp | act | obj | desc)+}}

#bb_1/22/20: intro is a misc element
intro = element intro{text}

#bb_1/22/20: other important places in the hierarchy
exp = element exp{(type|act|obj|desc|text)*} #exp = explanation
desc = element desc{(type|act|obj|text)*}    #desc = description

#amp: This is the same as before: these two would be better written with mixed content! So: exp = element exp{mixed{(type | act | obj | desc)*}}
#desc = element desc{mixed{(type | act | obj)*}}

act = element act{type, text}                #act = action
obj = element obj{type, text}                #obj = object

#bb_1/22/20: attributes
num = attribute num{xsd:int}
type = attribute type{text}     #types: 
                                  #comp = computer
                                  #conc = concept
                                  #rel = relate
                                  #adj = adjective
                                  #spec = specific
                                  #unspec = unspecific

#amp: My first comment is about comments! I'm glad to see you using comments not only to leave notes to the instructors, but also to give information about decisions that you're making while coding. This is so helpful when it comes to projects that you're going to share publicly, because it allows others to see these choices and better understand your code. So, great work with that! 

#amp: Another thing that I like with your schema is the organization! You have clearly designated sections for your elements and attributes that make your code really clear. 

#amp: For the future, I would try working more with the other repetition indicators, as well as with datatypes! In this specific assignment, you could code for the date of the assignment, and use xsd:date or xsd:YearMonth (or both!) to give even more metadata in your xml. Overall, this is a well-organized, simple schema that you'll be able to develop into a more complex schema if you were to continue with it (and with future projects!)

                                           The beginner student, bb, experimenting with tidy, highly legible commentary on his code, including mapping
                           out attribute values he might use to replace the ambiguous text. But we also see students beginning to hear from each other
                           about project work on which they collaborate and getting used to seeing a code file as a site of productive conversation and
                           ongoing revision.

                        <p>When students learn only tagging and do not learn how to write schema validation or process their own code
                                           to visualize and analyze the data they have marked, they remain unaware of what the
                                           markup makes possible or of the problems imposed by
                                           imprecision and inconsistency. They may be tagging correctly, but not in a way that
                                           communicates meaningfully or reliably. As they first become aware of the human
                                           unreliabilities in applying markup, they may come away with a limited idea that the
                                           tree structures we create are necessarily subjective and arbitrary. They would be
                                           reinforced in this thinking by old arguments from those who find embedded markup a
                                           source of intrusive confusion. For example, Johanna Drucker has asserted that
                                           embedded markup confuses levels of discourse: <q>Putting content markers into
                                                  the plane of discourse (a tag that identifies the semantic value of a text
                                                  relies on reference, even though it is put directly into the character string)
                                                      <span class="ital">as if</span> they are marking the plane of reference is a
                                                  flawed practice. Markup, in its very basis, embodies a contradiction. It
                                                  collapses two distinct orders of linguistic operation in a confused and messy
                                                  way.</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e559" class="footnoteref" id="d0e559-ref">[23]</a></sup>Certainly messiness and confusion can be applied to an ill-conceived data
                                           model as well as it can to a piece of disorganized and unrevised writing. But

                                           comprehension, navigation, and processing by an informed reader of markup who is a
                                           member of a community of practice. Against Drucker&#8217;s dismissal of markup as mess we
                                           should counter the frequent practice in the markup community of <span class="ital">blind

                           </div> Far from posing a <q>mess</q>, the actions of documenting
                                           descriptive markup make it sustainable and sharable when the encoder is removed in
                                           time and space and technological delivery system from those who encounter the code.
                                           Blind interchange is the benefit of the tangle and weave of literate programming,
                                           and it is reinforced by communities that encounter the code and interact with it.
                                           Understood in this way, the <q>mess</q> of markup is indistinguishable from
                                           the <q>mess</q> of writing; both may be ordered with care and explanation
                                           for an audience, first an audience of one&#8217;s instructor and peers, and then an
                                           audience one does not necessarily meet in person.

                        <p>Teaching students how to query their XML code and how to transform it for publication encourages new systems of thinking and
                                       gives writers access to their own means of production. The learning required takes
                                       weeks, not years, and is suitably incorporated in a university semester without needing
                                       specialized computing prerequisites. Not until we teach students how to customize, query, or transform their markup

                                           <span class="ital">writing intensive</span>. By way of reference, the Pennsylvania State
                                       University&#8217;s cross-curricular definition of a writing intensive course requires that
                                       writing be used <q>to help students learn course content</q>, as well as
                                           <q>ways of writing in the discipline</q>, and that it have formal
                                       expectations delivered in structured assignments. These expectations are familiar to us from
                                       university composition courses in the requirements for research papers and thesis
                                       documents with structured sections, appendices, but can also be communicated in the
                                       context of encoding XML projects according to a carefuly developed schema and a
                                       well-documented codebase. Most importantl and pertinent to XML project development is
                                       the expectation that writing-intensive courses engage in significant rounds of revision:

                           </div> Markup and coding with the XML family of languages becomes an
                                           <span class="ital">intensive</span> writing experience when students return to it and
                                       revise it, to better document decisions for the project team, to better document
                                       decisions for readers outside the project, to improve the precision of the data, to
                                       simplify the categories to make the code more coherent in categorizing and processing
                                       information. When students learn to inspect the code and share its customization in
                                       project teams, the markup becomes subject to intensive review and systematic revision to
                                       make it sharable rather than subjective. The more this is done, and the more experience
                                       that students and scholars gain, the more prepared they are to share in wider
                                       conversations. For example, markup practitioners in the classicist community share
                                       applications of the EpiDoc standard, and a medievalist graduate student prepares to
                                       speak at the annual conference of the Text Encoding Initiative or at the annual
                                       Kalamazoo International Congress on Medieval Studies. As with peer-reviewed scholarship
                                       in any discipline, the XML code-base is subject optimally to heated debate and decisions
                                       are made befitting communities of practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>Because the XML family of languages is amenable to rapid learning, a student can
                                       become a <q>stack developer</q> easily in the course of a semester, as Clifford
                                       Anderson observed of the course he taught students in XQuery: <q>XQuery makes it
                                              possible for students to become productive without having to learn as many computer
                                              science or software engineering concepts. A simple four or five line FLWOR
                                              expression can easily demonstrate the power of XQuery and provide a basis for
                                              students' tinkering and exploration.</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e641" class="footnoteref" id="d0e641-ref">[26]</a></sup> As XQuery developers know, the simple
                                       "for", "let" "where", "order by" and "return" statements that make a "FLWOR" are good
                                       ways to introduce students to programming concepts quickly and give them powers to
                                       construct all kinds of new data structures from an XML document, whether HTML, SVG
                                       (scaleable vector graphics), or structured text formats like CSVs to be imported into
                                       spreadsheets, or JSON formats for structured maps and arrays. Students work at the intersections of different
                           data formats with exploring what they can build out of XML trees. Bringing students to work at these intersections between
                           data formats leads code-writers to a decision making
                                       process about streamlining the code-base, making it more legible, tractable, XPath-able.
                                       Learning XPath and writing XSLT or XQuery to process XML moves a
                                       coder from following rules obediently so that others will someday process the data, to becoming
                                       an active intellectual investigator who can wield markup as a skilled professional writer.

                     <p>University students can and do create projects <q>built to last</q>, that is,

                                    addressing the poetry of Emily Dickinson.
                     </p>
                     <p>The first is a proof-of-concept proposal for a PhD thesis prepared by then graduate
                                    student at University of Virginia, Michele Ierardi, and as of 2020, it is now only
                                    accessible on the web from the Wayback Machine: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191014042502/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~ajf2j/emily/stab.html" class="link" target="_new">Translating Emily: Digitally Re-Presenting Fascicle 16</a>.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e667" class="footnoteref" id="d0e667-ref">[27]</a></sup> The project involved an exercise applying 1990s HTML and an early form of
                                    JavaScript to render Emily Dickinson&#8217;s handwritten variants on her own poems in a way
                                    that did not demote those variants to a footnote, but gave them equal space using the
                                    capacities of hypertext. On reading a Dickinson&#8217;s poems on the site, the reader would
                                    encounter Dickinson&#8217;s own different versions of a line in slowly flashing text. The
                                    editor&#8217;s hope in designing her interface was to make readers more aware of Dickinson&#8217;s
                                    open-endedness, in not cancelling out multiple versions of a line, that all
                                    possibilities could coexist. The site was a proof of concept that did not materialize
                                    into a PhD thesis project, but it persisted and influenced my teaching of American
                                    Literature courses when I wanted to share Dickinson&#8217;s unusual writing process with my
                                    students and give them an experience of an interesting and accessible (if slightly
                                    hypnotizing) digital edition interface. The JavaScript on the site ceased to function
                                    around 2010, and soon thereafter I began seeking a way to continue accessing this
                                    cleanly and simply encoded project in a way that would still benefit my students.
                     </p>
                     <p>In 2015, soon after I had begun teaching courses in coding and the XML stack at
                                    Pitt-Greensburg, I was fortunate to find a group of students interested in poetry and
                                    fascinated by the possibilities of digital archive recovery work. The students and I
                                    contacted Michele Ierardi and obtained her permission to reconstruct her site. This
                                    involved converting the code from HTML to TEI P5, as well as adding more data researched
                                    and supplied by my students to include TEI critical apparatus markup that would encode
                                    Dickinson&#8217;s variants as well as other printed versions of the same poems in a series of
                                    editions published after Dickinson&#8217;s death. Their new goal was to build on Ierardi&#8217;s
                                    work and create a readable interface for comparing the multiple versions of Dickinson&#8217;s
                                    poems, and to begin expanding that work to include other fascicles (the term for the
                                    bundles of poems that Dickinson tied together with thread). My students&#8217; site is the
                                    second <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/" class="link" target="_new">Emily Dickinson project</a>,
                                    strongly bound to the first.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e682" class="footnoteref" id="d0e682-ref">[28]</a></sup> These students have since graduated from university, but they continue to
                                    work on this project, adding a new fascicle and tinkering with the interface, and I
                                    understand from the ongoing project director, Nicole Lottig, that she intends to
                                    continue coding and developing the site to display all of Dickinson&#8217;s fascicles as a
                                    long-term project. An excellent sampling of the project&#8217;s interface for reading a
                                    Dickinson poem and seeing its variant texts and images together is its display of <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/16/1605.html" class="link" target="_new">Poem 1605</a>, which
                                    shows how most of the early print editions cut out Dickinson&#8217;s entire last stanza and
                                    typically ignored her variants. 
                                    The editors share <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/16/xml/1605variant.xml" class="link" target="_new">their TEI code
                                           from the interface</a>, which applies critical apparatus markup with parallel segmentation in
                                    the TEI. The students opted to represent all witnesses even when they were silent, as demonstrated in their coding
                        decisions for the last stanza of poem 1605. They also faced a significant challenge to encode Dickinson&#8217;s uncanceled variant
                        passages in her manuscript, and found a way to do this by applying the <code class="code">@type</code> attribute with values of "var0" and "var1":
                                <pre class="programlisting">

                                In their transformation to HTML (linked above), the students applied JavaScript and CSS to the variant data coded
                        in these attributes to produce a dynamic and distinctive reading interface permitting the reader a ready view of comparison
                        data. 
                                </p>
                     <p>In preparing this project, the students had the benefit of building on an earlier and
                                    simpler markup model, as well as a sense of purpose in giving a remarkably interesting
                                    project a new lease on life. They needed to study the TEI P5 guidelines and essentially
                                    took a <q>crash course</q>, as undergraduates from a range of majors in English,
                                    Creative Writing, and Information Sciences in manuscript encoding and textual
                                    scholarship, in the course of a semester. They learned to transform the code and
                                    designed the interface in the Fall 2015 semester, and then redesigned and improved the
                                    interface while investigating a new research question in a following Spring 2016 term.
                                    Over the course of one year, in the context of university coursework, the students not only designed a new reading
                        interface but also explored a
                                    serious research question of how these editions compare to one another. Writing XSLT and
                                    XQuery on the project, these students produced SVG visualizations of <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/16/dash.html" class="link" target="_new"><q>Comparative Dash
                                                  Reduction</q></a> (measuring which editions most frequently normalized
                                    Dickinson&#8217;s dash punctuation into commas, semicolons, or periods), and <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/16/networkAnalysis.html" class="link" target="_new">a network
                                           analysis</a> to investigate which editions share the most variants in common.
                                    This was created with XQuery to pull and calculate data from the TEI critical apparatus markup they had modelled
                        for the poems. 
                                    The network analysis explored how frequently published versions aligned with Dickinson&#8217;s writing in the manuscript
                        versions, based on generating counts with XPath of how frequently a particular version (coded as a reading witness) aligned
                        with other versions. The students wrote XQuery code to extract this data into simple TSV
                                    (tab-separated values file) and plotted in Cytoscape network analysis software. The programming work they did
                        with XQuery was built on a foundation of their own care in modeling the markup and designing the rules for the project schema.
                     </p>
                     <p>The student website documents its methodology extensively and I now use it as a model
                                    for my current students to prepare documentation that <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/16/conclusion.html" class="link" target="_new">features code and
                                           coding decisions</a>. Along the way of producing it and sustaining their
                                    codebase, the project team cultivated <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/contact.html" class="link" target="_new">multiple GitHub repositories
                                           with issue tracking</a> as they turned to new sources of data and worked to
                                    combine Fascicles 6 and 16 into a new site. Their writing intensive experience involved
                                    countless messages to each other to fix broken code, make a visualization work, update
                                    the website, refine the CSS and JavaScript. The professional experience with web
                                    development was took them far beyond what would be possible in a course in tagging and
                                    markup alone, or in web development within a content management system. The writing
                                    intensive part was unquestionably in producing and testing and refining their own
                                    interface. And the project keeps on giving to future students.

                     <p>In Fall 2019, a colleague of mine from the History department, William Campbell, did me
                                    the great honor of taking my coding course, following a tradition at Pitt begun when I
                                    took David Birnbaum&#8217;s XML-stack coding course on Obdurodon in Spring 2013.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d0e726" class="footnoteref" id="d0e726-ref">[29]</a></sup>. Campbell launched <a href="http://brecon.newtfire.org" class="link" target="_new">The Brecon
                                           Project</a>, together with students on his team, to study the manuscript
                                    tradition of the foundation charter of a Reformation-era collegiate church and school
                                    in Wales. The students did not need to know medieval Latin to work on the document data
                                    modeling and even to apply critical apparatus markup with a tightly controlled schema
                                    combining Relax NG and Schematron, generated from a TEI ODD customization that they
                                    devised and revised over the course of their project meetings. For the students and my
                                    History colleague involved in the project, this was their introduction to the TEI
                                    critical apparatus as a document data model. They turned to previous projects
                                    from our course to follow some examples of critical apparatus markup in order to
                                    understand how to prepare their own.
                                    Without needing to consult the Dickinson project team, the Brecon team was able to adapt
                                    and build on the example of their markup to take their own study in new directions, recognizing how their project
                        diverged. For the Brecon team, the text of the charter was not a
                                    bundle of poems, but nevertheless required a modeling of textual variation over time.
                                    Alyssa Argento, a returning student who was mentoring project teams and continuing
                                    learning XSLT and SVG on her own, took on the challenge of trying to show how the
                                    manuscript and print witnesses compared quantitatively: which versions of the charter shared the most material
                        in common,
                                    inspired by the example of the network analysis on the Dickinson project. Finding her
                                    computer unable to install the latest version of the network analysis software that the
                                    Dickinson team had relied on for their visualization, Argento studied the project data, worked out
                                    how to arrange eight witnesses as nodes in a circle, and produced a network graph by
                                    herself with weighted edges and sized nodes to provide a detailed visual summary of
                                    how much the eight different versions shared in common across 25 sections of the
                                    charter. Having produced a static network visualization, she then studied how to
                                    make it interactive by applying JavaScript to address attributes on the SVG elements and
                                    to associate those SVG elements with corresponding columns and rows in HTML tables containing data from each section
                        of the charter. Her
                                    interactive visualization, accessible at <a href="http://brecon.newtfire.org/html/analysis/network.html " class="link" target="_new">http://brecon.newtfire.org/html/analysis/network.html</a> represents work that
                                    she envisioned and worked out by herself with occasional input from me and the project
                                    team, and while it needs work in the documentation area, it represents a line of
                                    succession from earlier projects in my course. I share it here to demonstrate what is
                                    possible for undergraduates to learn, very quickly, with the benefit of the XML
                                    stack.

                     <p> When students prepare a project in markup, they are not simply writing papers to be
                                    filed in a course-specific context. They are preparing a research site and their work
                                    can often be continued by them or others. Students can be building beyond the
                                    constraints of a single semester, and even if they are not tempted to return to the
                                    project, they can leave scaffolding behind for others to continue the work or alter its
                                    direction, or retrieve the files. Awareness of the potential energy of the work they are
                                    doing can give shape to an encounter with markup languages in the course of a semester.
                                    The energy input over a course of weeks puts emphasis on preparing material that others

                                    not students go on to use markup again after the course is over, they will have engaged
                                    with a powerful form of writing that marks up, investigates, curates, propagates, and
                                    conserves textual data. This is the very definition of a writing-intensive experience
                                    that is both professionalizing and cross-disciplinary in its reach.

                     <p>Teaching a writing-intensive course in markup modalities offers little distress for
                                    adaptation to a remote learning environment. In March 2020, when the author&#8217;s
                                    university (then the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg) closed the campus and moved
                                    all courses online, there was little difficulty in transferring learning materials to a
                                    new format because we had already been relying on tutorials and assignments we had
                                    written and posted on the web, but more importantly because we had already developed a
                                    sense of community in the forms of asynchronous conversation cultivated not in the
                                    learning management system but rather in GitHub and on Slack. Prior to the pandemic
                                    quarantine, during January and February project teams already had developed asynchronous
                                    connections, reinforced by their own emojis (a rubber duck meme associated with rubber
                                    duck debugging, for example). The coding class might properly be recognized as
                                        <q>flipped</q>, in which most of the learning was already taking place in an
                                    applied context outside of class, while student and faculty class meetings reviewed
                                    content all together, to learn how to interact with an unfamiliar interface or to review
                                    issues students are having or help address something that is not working. It was easy to
                                    continue the management of a course based on markup technologies in which students had
                                    been trained to work with project management tools and to be writing and sharing their
                                    documentation in GitHub repositories and over Slack channels. We did miss the in-person
                                    interaction on which this class relied, with instructors able to look over the shoulders
                                    of students to help resolve a problem on their computers. Synchronous virtual meetings
                                    could not replace this, but using screen captures in asynchronous chat became more
                                    necessary, and students are certainly challenged to verbalize things that are not
                                    working properly when an instructor cannot come around behind the student&#8217;s computer to see what is
                                    going wrong. But adding comments to code stored in the class&#8217;s shared eXist-dB XML database and their project
                        GitHub repositories
                                    continued as it had from the beginning of the semester. Because this class had cultivated tools to be able to
                                    communicate and work together online, they were perhaps less challenged and more bonded virtually than
                                    students in the courses managed only within the learning management system. Build teams
                                    of developers in a class, and a pandemic may slow but not stop them. In the pandemic crisis of 2020
                                    the writing intensive nature of shared project development seemed especially beneficial in
                                    supporting our hive of student coders.
