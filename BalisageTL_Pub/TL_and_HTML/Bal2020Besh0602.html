                        <p>Can learning text encoding and markup languages constitute a <q>writing
                              intensive</q> experience for university students? The author is developing a
                           Text Encoding Fundamentals course with emphasis on text encoding as writing, as well
                           as a proposal that this fulfill a major state university requirement of a
                           research-oriented 300-level <q>writing intensive</q> or <q>W</q>
                           course for undergraduate students. The course is specifically
                           designed for those pursuing a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology major but must
                           also be available to others in related disciplines as an experience in <q>writing across the curriculum</q>. While we may be familiar with
                           arguments that coding and programming are a kind of literacy, the idea that
                           developing projects with markup technologies may constitute an
                           <span class="ital">intensive</span> writing experience is less familiar. The
                           consideration of text encoding as writing intensive may establish a call for
                           teaching markup technologies more widely in a cross-disciplinary context.</p>
                        <p>Not just any course introducing students to markup should be considered writing
                           intensive. Arguably, a class that involves tagging exercises without project
                           development and invites students to write reflectively about the experience is not
                           engaging in an <span class="ital">intensive</span> way with the writing work we associate
                           with coding in a project development context. This paper argues that a
                           <span class="ital">writing intensive</span> course in coding should take seriously
                           the notion that coding and programming is a writing process that requires research
                           and citation, algorithmic problem-solving and decision making, task management to
                           organize a project team, and documentation to share the work and help others to
                           build upon it. A course offering such experiences should, finally, be accessible to
                           students from several disciplines, whether to a junior year English or history major
                           with little to no programming experience, or a junior year computer science or
                           information technology major with an interest in applied programming, unused to
                           research questions that drive humanities scholarship. In presenting its case, this
                           paper responds to a range of literature to evaluate the relationships among
                           <span class="ital">encoding</span>, <span class="ital">coding</span>,
                           <span class="ital">programming</span>, and <span class="ital">writing</span>.</p>

                     <p>To any academic who remembers the exhilaration in the 1990s of navigating around an
                        Andrew File System and posting on it a <q>paperless syllabus</q> in a markup language, the application of the phrase <q>teaching with technology</q> in the university
                        discourse of the 2010s may have a jarring sound. Scholarly markup geeks
                        from a past century have lived to see <q>technology</q> for education be
                        packaged in learning management systems that securely take care of all of our
                        electronic interactions with students from posting announcements to grades. Even for
                        90s markup geeks, learning our way around the
                        technologies driving Blackboard and Canvas can be abstruse and fretfully time-consuming,
                        especially when we attempt applying their byzantine integrations with various proprietary
                        software applications like Zoom or Panopto. Publications supporting
                        educational technology innovations make evident that educational software applications
                        are universally expected to
                        be integrated and accessed from within a learning management system (LMS). For example,
                        Hypothes.is, an
                        open-source technology for web annotation is now packaged and funneled into an LMS
                        with
                        a proprietary gradebook integration, or faculty may not be aware of its existence
                        or
                        understand how to apply it in their courses.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e85" class="footnoteref" id="d2e85-ref">[1]</a></sup> A group of faculty from Seton Hall university found that <q>teaching
                           with technology, can be the way to bridge perceived differences between disciplines,
                           especially at the developmental stages of a writing-across-the-curriculum
                           program</q>, and in their work to develop new technologically-enhanced courses,
                        they concentrate on the interactive writing opportunities afforded by faculty’s
                        encounter with a university-wide investment in a learning management system.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e95" class="footnoteref" id="d2e95-ref">[2]</a></sup> We now rely on markup-based management architectures that control university
                        website delivery and our work in the <q>technology</q> of higher education is
                        widely presumed to be about form-filling, at most using a limited tag set from a menu
                        system. We have been acculturated to expect that composition and digital media classes
                        like <q>Writing for the
                           Web</q> are and <span class="ital">should be</span> about writing in Wordpress
                        templates that provide carefully constrained and little-investigated access to the
                        code
                        layer. <q>We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us,</q> wrote Henry
                        David Thoreau, and we might as well update that for today’s university content
                        management systems: we do not direct the content management system, it directs us.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e115" class="footnoteref" id="d2e115-ref">[3]</a></sup>
                        </p>
                     <p>Although we have little practical choice but to commit to developing course materials
                        in frameworks that we do not choose for ourselves, those frameworks (e.g. Blackboard,
                        Moodle, Canvas) are built from XML building blocks which the savvy customer can occasionally
                        learn about to try to modify parts of the system permissible to access. <sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e129" class="footnoteref" id="d2e129-ref">[4]</a></sup>. XML establishes the context of educational technology in our educational institutions,
                        but the way in which we access it is carefully gated in ways that benefit us but also
                        relegate the technology under the hood to the level of the abstruse and esoteric.
                        Those of us who teach students to write and build projects with markup technologies
                        may be few in number, but we are the ones who are aware of the skills our students
                        rapidly develop and hone over the course of a single semester—skills to build data
                        models, a search interfaces, and informational graphics according to their own design
                        and not funnelled through one or two particular brands of software. Learning XML with
                        its family of languages helps students to develop independently from <q>black box</q> software, and also helps make them informed consumers to choose the software they
                        want to commit to particular tasks, to find the software most amenable to user alterations
                        <q>under the hood</q> and most friendly to transporting the data when the software does not last. Learning
                        markup technologies is a way of learning the structures of the web of information,
                        and much the way we learn to write with and against the formal genre expectations
                        of an essay or a poem, we learn formal ways of containing data and relating metadata
                        in an XML framework in ways that are influenced by our interests in processing, sharing,
                        accessing the data. We write things that be read and acted upon by humans; and we
                        write markup to be read and parsed and acted upon by humans and machines.</p>
                     <p>XML markup and its family of languages itself has not become more abstruse or difficult
                        to learn since the millenium. Indeed, instruction is much easier now with many tutorials
                        available and more powerful processing methods available now.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e142" class="footnoteref" id="d2e142-ref">[5]</a></sup> However, the learning of markup technologies and the XML stack has been cultivated
                        too narrowly to be recognized as a general skillset beneficial to students across
                        disciplines. Given universities’ deep investment in XML-based ecosystems, can we imagine
                        a widely-accessible cross-disciplinary course that inverts the relationship between
                        code and form-box, that engages students and faculty in organizing ideas with markup
                        languages that they themselves control? This paper argues that a sustained learning
                        and application of markup technologies, not as implicit structure, but as explicit
                        document data modeling and development, should serve as a broadly accessible cross-disciplinary
                        writing-intensive experience in its own right. This exploration should open doors
                        to students who would otherwise not consider themselves <q>tech savvy</q> or capable programmers.</p>

                        lauded context for teaching markup languages in a writing-intensive way. For writing

                        When coding is understood as literacy, its nexus with writing becomes explicit when
                        we think of it on the same terms as developing language skills. Coding should be as
                        ubiquitous and familiar to students as the writing they have been learning since childhood.
                        Coding does not belong to computer science departments any more than writing belongs
                        to English departments, as David J. Birnbaum and Alison Langmead make explicit:

                                 be given the opportunity to learn to do it in ways that are appropriate for their
                                 disciplines. We offer humanists years of practice in learning to write; let us give
                                 them the chance also to learn to code. The second step is to recognize that learning

                        These are analogies to learning to write or learning a foreign language, intended
                        to persuade humanists to adopt coding into their disciplines, but the analogies do
                        not in themselves constitute an argument for coding and programming as potentially
                        an intensive professional writing experience for students of any discipline.</p>
                     <p>That argument for the writing-intensiveness of coding can be found <q>outside</q> the humanities. In the context of programming education, Felienne Hermans and Marlies
                        Aldewereld propose that more students would be interested in computer science if they
                        learned to program in a way that followed models for learning to write. They suggest
                        that programming instruction would be improved if it adapted the way writing instructors
                        model examples of their writing process for students to break it down into discrete
                        tasks more efficiently. They cite a study in which the elementary students comprehended
                        scientific concepts better when they were assigned short writing assignments that
                        engaged the topic. The suggestion that writing reflectively and observantly, and understanding
                        a context for a program to be working makes the material more widely accessible and
                        <q>could help a broader group of kids identify as programmers!</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e215" class="footnoteref" id="d2e215-ref">[10]</a></sup> Indeed, this emphasis on writing to learn a science enacts a return to an earlier
                        and more integrated approach to education, before the <q>sciences</q> had become formally distinct from <q>humanities</q>: the late eighteenth century saw the scientific poems of Erasmus Darwin and calls
                        for poetry that would bring zoology and botany to life and encourage sympathy with

                        a long time now. But futher, as Hermans and Alderweld point out, students can learn
                        programming more easily if they are taught in the mode of writing instruction, with

                        reproduction of writing. Knuth’s now-familiar concept seems simple in hindsight: <q>Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let

                        XSLT stylesheets by applying namespaces to permit the tangling of actionable code

                     <p>REWORK THIS. The XML family of languages were designed not only to be widely accessible,
                        but also to be a vocabulary that the writer controls or consults or interacts with
                        in a hierarchical structure. It does not take very long to acquaint new coders to
                        the rules of how to tag a document, or how to turn a <q>plain text</q> document into an XML document, though often people experience a little frustration
                        with typing in the attributes or figuring what they can do with attributes. The first
                        week or two of a class that involves markup methods can orient people to how to code
                        something in XML, but the interesting experience of that can be when we ask students
                        to develop their own hierarchies to organize what they are reading, and when we invite
                        our students to try to recognize what is implicit, and find ways to use elements,
                        attributes, or comments to make that explicit. The act of inscribing markup has been
                        recognized (CITE KATE SINGER) as a writing process, but if it goes no further than
                        an exercise in tagging, perhaps we should consider this something like writing a reflective
                        paper, a response that sharpens one’s observation and critical thinking skills. In
                        my years of teaching undergraduates to code, I notice in the first couple of weeks
                        that certain students have difficulties with conceptualizing dependencies, or what
                        the relationship between an element and an attribute and its value ought to be. They
                        sometimes prepare shallow hierarchies, and instead of bundling list items together
                        in a cluster, make a very flat tree where every line is its own entry. These students
                        benefit from seeing more detailed markup, and also from understanding something about
                        how the markup may be processed, how it can be used to organize and access particular
                        kinds of information. For that reason, I have found that inviting my students to write
                        their first markup on a recipe, one that contains an interesting variety of ingredients,
                        measurement units, and activities, provides a very clear and easily recognizable sense
                        of structure with lots of categories of information. [CITE Newtfire XML EX 1] So,
                        too, does a poem, or a piece of historical correspondence. Students who have difficulty
                        constructing dependent clauses may find the preparation of an informative, non-redundant
                        hierarchy just as challenging. Quite frequently student beginners will take the text
                        content of a document and repeat it in an attribute value, as for example wrapping
                        code around a name as given in a text, and using that name in an attribute value on
                        the element, until they receive some suggestions that they might want to use the attribute
                        as a key for a standard identifier whenever this individual is mentioned by their
                        various names.</p>
                     <p>Learning to code the XML syntax is easy. Learning to optimize one’s preparation of

                        thesis. Just like these progressively more complex writing activities, we can identify
                        levels of intensity in increasing applications of markup technologies, and the challenges
                        to the thinking and communication process are remarkably similar. The increasing intensity
                        is not simply due to learning new technologies, but rather becomes gradually more
                        intensive in cognitive ways. The process of becoming a better reader and writer and
                        coder and developer is also the process of becoming more adept in organizing and processing
                        information. Writing may be easily recognizable in the practice we call mere tagging
                        in first-time coders, but the way one becomes a better writer with markup is by learning
                        what can be done with and made from the markup. The processes of navigating, extracting,
                        transforming, and remixing data marked in an XML tree define the <span class="ital">intensive</span>  part of the writing process. When students learn only tagging and do not learn how
                        to parse their own code, they remain unaware of what the markup makes possible, and
                        they may often be unaware of the problems imposed by imprecision and inconsistency.
                        They may be tagging correctly, but not in a way that communicates meaningfully or
                        reliably. Worse yet, in becoming aware of the human unreliabilities in applying markup,
                        they may come away with the idea that the tree structures we create are arbitrary,
                        exert an aggressive control over a document. [CITE] This line of thinking relies on
                        an unsustained, non-intensive engagement with marked documents and an unfortunate
                        separation of the technologies of managing and processing XML from instruction in
                        markup.</p>
                     <p>Just as we think of free-writing as a valuable exercise to start a first preliminary
                        draft in a composition class, in teaching markup, a certain amount of mess and unreliability
                        is okay as we are learning or figuring out what matters to prioritize. Often new coders
                        introduce far more differently named elements than they really need, or that would
                        be baffling to keep track of in a real-life project. To come to an understanding of
                        how to code helpfully and meaningfully, a student needs to confront the problem of
                        sharing and reproducibility—concepts parallel to the awareness of an audience emphasized
                        in rhetoric and composition classes as a means to craft better sentences, to trim
                        out verbosity.</p>
                     <p>Students often improve their markup dramatically when they learn to write Relax NG
                        schema code, that creates rules for encoding. This may be a first data-modeling experience
                        for students in a general education context, when they are called upon to think in
                        a <q>meta</q> or higher order reflective way about formalizing their code, and making it possible
                        for others to understand it and reproduce it.</p>

                        DOCUMENTATION and SHARING the work: establishing a context
                        When students prepare a project in markup, they are not simply writing papers to be
                        filed in a course-specific context. They are preparing a research site and their work
                        can often be continued by them or others. Students can be building beyond the constraints
                        of a single semester, and even if they are not tempted to return to the project, they
                        can leave scaffolding behind for others to continue the work or alter its direction,
                        or retrieve the files. Awareness of the potential energy of the work they are doing
                        can give shape to an encounter with markup languages in the course of a semester.
                        The energy input over a course of weeks puts emphasis on preparing material that others
                        can read and reuse. Indeed, assignments for a writing intensive experience can be
                        constructed with attention to:
                        1) reading the code and documentation of other projects, and building on it
                        2) preparing documentation meant to be read by peers and professor(s) working with
                        you, and meant to be read by others who access your code from a repository. Such documentation
                        may include:
                        * Kanban board workflow management
                        * README.md files
                        * task lists and issues
                        * being responsible and <q>on-call</q> for responding to questions and assisting your teammates
                        
                        These are activities to do with taking responsibility for method and processes, for
                        managing the intellectual content of a project. Studying how copyright applies to
                        code and markup and choosing a license for sharing the work should be part of this
                        experience. 
                        Giving students access to the full set of tools in the XML arsenal and establishing
                        both immediate (in-semester) short-range and long-range possibilities for their work
                        will introduce students from any background to the power of markup languages and with
                        the experience of writing to form and connect with communities of practice. This cannot
                        fail to be a professionalizing experience. Even in developing projects that are not
                        successful, there will be opportunities to recognize in failures what to document,
                        how to redo the work differently, how another group might start over—the project-oriented
                        awareness gives space for documentation to <q>sunset</q> the work. Whether or not students go on to use markup again after the course is over,
                        they will have engaged with a powerful form of writing that marks up, investigates,
                        curates, propagates, and conserves textual data. This is the very definition of a
                        writing-intensive experience that is both professionalizing and cross-disciplinary
                        in its reach.

                        How hard is this for Humanities faculty to learn? 
                        Faculty workshops and training can provide it, but it is not often offered, and perhaps
                        we need to overcome a presumption that faculty will not be interested in the material.
                        Where do we markup practitioners imagine that we find an audience for instructional
                        materials? Who should be learning these technologies? Can this be treated not <span class="ital">only</span> as a restricted technological preserve, but as an encounter with what digital texts
                        can be made of, as a component of digital literacy for humanities faculty and graduate
                        programs? Can we encourage and incentivize the learning, teaching, and sharing of
                        these technologies? The author learned enough of a foundation in a range of languages
                        in a 15-week semester thanks to the existence of a course taught by David J. Birnbaum
                        in the University of Pittsburgh’s Honors College program CITE, and she learned alongside
                        a group of undergraduates, working in teams on semester projects as described in this
                        paper. While she took the course to learn how to develop a digital edition project,
                        she exited with the basis for developing new courses and imagining new ways of working
                        on projects with students. Other faculty at Pitt and Pitt-Greensburg have lit their
                        torches from the same pedagogical fires, and we are aware of faculty at UVic, U of
                        Maryland, Bucknell, and Vanderbilt (just to name a few) who teach humanities students
                        to engage with a range of XML technologies. 
                        
                        Teaching Markup Languages during a Pandemic
                        Teaching a writing-intensive course in markup modalities offers little distress for
                        adaptation to a remote learning environment, as we had to do recently after the university
                        closed down face-to-face classes. This kind of class works for connecting synchronously
                        OR asynchronously. It was much easier to continue the management of a course based
                        on markup technologies in which students had been trained to work with project management
                        tools and to be writing and sharing their documentation in GitHub repositories and
                        over Slack channels than to retool one in which in-class daily discussion and traditional
                        kinds of assignments prevailed. The digital modalities organizing our class were lively
                        enough that the coding class might properly be recognized as <q>flipped</q>, in which most of the learning was already taking place in an applied context outside
                        of class, while student and faculty class meetings reviewed content all together,
                        to learn how to interact with an unfamiliar interface or to review issues students
                        are having or help address something that is not working.
