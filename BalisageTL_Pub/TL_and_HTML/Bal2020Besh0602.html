                        <p>Can learning text encoding and markup languages constitute a <q>writing
                              intensive</q> experience for university students? The author is developing a
                           Text Encoding Fundamentals course with emphasis on text encoding as writing, as well
                           as a proposal that this fulfill a major state university requirement of a
                           research-oriented 300-level <q>writing intensive</q> or <q>W</q>
                           course for undergraduate students. The course is specifically
                           designed for those pursuing a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology major but must
                           also be available to others in related disciplines as an experience in <q>writing across the curriculum</q>. While we may be familiar with
                           arguments that coding and programming are a kind of literacy, the idea that
                           developing projects with markup technologies may constitute an
                           <span class="ital">intensive</span> writing experience is less familiar. The
                           consideration of text encoding as writing intensive may establish a call for
                           teaching markup technologies more widely in a cross-disciplinary context.</p>
                        <p>Not just any course introducing students to markup should be considered writing
                           intensive. Arguably, a class that involves tagging exercises without project
                           development and invites students to write reflectively about the experience is not
                           engaging in an <span class="ital">intensive</span> way with the writing work we associate
                           with coding in a project development context. This paper argues that a
                           <span class="ital">writing intensive</span> course in coding should take seriously
                           the notion that coding and programming is a writing process that requires research
                           and citation, algorithmic problem-solving and decision making, task management to
                           organize a project team, and documentation to share the work and help others to
                           build upon it. A course offering such experiences should, finally, be accessible to
                           students from several disciplines, whether to a junior year English or history major
                           with little to no programming experience, or a junior year computer science or
                           information technology major with an interest in applied programming, unused to
                           research questions that drive humanities scholarship. In presenting its case, this
                           paper explores a range of literature to locate intersections between digital writing
                           modalities discussed in the context of composition courses and the concept of literate
                           programming that grounds the XML family of languages.</p>

                     <p>To any academic who remembers the exhilaration in the 1990s of navigating around an
                        Andrew File System and posting on it a <q>paperless syllabus</q> in a markup language, the application of the phrase <q>teaching with technology</q> in the university
                        discourse of the 2010s may have a jarring sound. Scholarly markup geeks
                        from a past century have lived to see <q>technology</q> for education be
                        packaged in learning management systems that securely take care of all of our
                        electronic interactions with students from posting announcements to grades. Even for
                        90s markup geeks, learning our way around the
                        technologies driving Blackboard and Canvas can be abstruse and fretfully time-consuming,
                        especially when we attempt applying their byzantine integrations with various proprietary
                        software applications like Zoom or Panopto. Publications supporting
                        educational technology innovations make evident that educational software applications
                        are universally expected to
                        be integrated and accessed from within a learning management system (LMS). For example,
                        Hypothes.is, an
                        open-source technology for web annotation is now packaged and funneled into an LMS
                        with
                        a proprietary gradebook integration, or faculty may not be aware of its existence
                        or
                        understand how to apply it in their courses.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e76" class="footnoteref" id="d2e76-ref">[1]</a></sup> A group of faculty from Seton Hall university found that <q>teaching
                           with technology, can be the way to bridge perceived differences between disciplines,
                           especially at the developmental stages of a writing-across-the-curriculum
                           program</q>, and in their work to develop new technologically-enhanced courses,
                        they concentrate on the interactive writing opportunities afforded by faculty’s
                        encounter with a university-wide investment in a learning management system.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e86" class="footnoteref" id="d2e86-ref">[2]</a></sup> We now rely on markup-based management architectures that control university
                        website delivery and our work in the <q>technology</q> of higher education is
                        widely presumed to be about form-filling, at most using a limited tag set from a menu
                        system. We have been acculturated to expect that composition and digital media classes
                        like <q>Writing for the
                           Web</q> are and <span class="ital">should be</span> about writing in Wordpress
                        templates that provide carefully constrained and little-investigated access to the
                        code
                        layer. <q>We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us,</q> wrote Henry
                        David Thoreau, and we might as well update that for today’s university content
                        management systems: we do not direct the content management system, it directs us.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e106" class="footnoteref" id="d2e106-ref">[3]</a></sup>

                     <p>Although we have little practical choice but to commit to developing course materials
                        in frameworks that we do not choose for ourselves, those frameworks (e.g. Blackboard,

                        learn about to try to modify parts of the system permissible to access. <sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e120" class="footnoteref" id="d2e120-ref">[4]</a></sup>. XML establishes the context of educational technology in our educational institutions,
                        but the way in which we access it is carefully gated in ways that benefit us but also
                        relegate the technology under the hood to the level of the abstruse and esoteric.
                        Those of us who teach students to write and build projects with markup technologies
                        may be few in number, but we are the ones who are aware of the skills our students
                        rapidly develop and hone over the course of a single semester—skills to build data
                        models, a search interfaces, and informational graphics according to their own design
                        and not funnelled through one or two particular brands of software. Learning XML with
                        its family of languages helps students to develop independently from <q>black box</q> software, and also helps make them informed consumers to choose the software they
                        want to commit to particular tasks, to find the software most amenable to user alterations
                        <q>under the hood</q> and most friendly to transporting the data when the software does not last. Learning
                        markup technologies is a way of learning the structures of the web of information,
                        and much the way we learn to write with and against the formal genre expectations
                        of an essay or a poem, we learn formal ways of containing data and relating metadata
                        in an XML framework in ways that are influenced by our interests in processing, sharing,
                        accessing the data. We write things that be read and acted upon by humans; and we
                        write markup to be read and parsed and acted upon by humans and machines.</p>
                     <p>XML markup and its family of languages itself has not become more abstruse or difficult
                        to learn since the millenium. Indeed, instruction is much easier now with many tutorials
                        available and more powerful processing methods available now.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e133" class="footnoteref" id="d2e133-ref">[5]</a></sup> However, the learning of markup technologies and the XML stack has been cultivated
                        too narrowly to be recognized as a general skillset beneficial to students across
                        disciplines. Given universities’ deep investment in XML-based ecosystems, can we imagine
                        a widely-accessible cross-disciplinary course that inverts the relationship between
                        code and form-box, that engages students and faculty in organizing ideas with markup
                        languages that they themselves control? This paper argues that a sustained learning
                        and application of markup technologies, not as implicit structure, but as explicit
                        document data modeling and development, should serve as a broadly accessible cross-disciplinary
                        writing-intensive experience in its own right. This exploration should open doors
                        to students who would otherwise not consider themselves <q>tech savvy</q> or capable programmers.</p>

                        media forms) may provide faculty markup practitioners a well-established and widely
                        lauded context for teaching markup languages in a writing-intensive way. For writing

                        When coding is understood as literacy, its nexus with writing becomes explicit when
                        we think of it on the same terms as developing language skills. Coding should be as
                        ubiquitous and familiar to students as the writing they have been learning since childhood.
                        Coding does not belong to computer science departments any more than writing belongs
                        to English departments, as David J. Birnbaum and Alison Langmead make explicit:

                                 be given the opportunity to learn to do it in ways that are appropriate for their
                                 disciplines. We offer humanists years of practice in learning to write; let us give
                                 them the chance also to learn to code. The second step is to recognize that learning

                        These are analogies to learning to write or learning a foreign language, intended
                        to persuade humanists to adopt coding into their disciplines, but the analogies do
                        not in themselves constitute an argument for coding and programming as potentially
                        an intensive professional writing experience for students of any discipline.</p>
                     <p>That argument for the writing-intensiveness of coding can be found <q>outside</q> the humanities. In the context of programming education, Felienne Hermans and Marlies
                        Aldewereld propose that more students would be interested in computer science if they
                        learned to program in a way that followed models for learning to write. They suggest
                        that programming instruction would be improved if it adapted the way writing instructors
                        model examples of their writing process for students to break it down into discrete
                        tasks more efficiently. They cite a study in which the elementary students comprehended
                        scientific concepts better when they were assigned short writing assignments that
                        engaged the topic. The suggestion that writing reflectively and observantly, and understanding
                        a context for a program to be working makes the material more widely accessible and
                        <q>could help a broader group of kids identify as programmers!</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e206" class="footnoteref" id="d2e206-ref">[10]</a></sup> Indeed, this emphasis on writing to learn a science enacts a return to an earlier
                        and more integrated approach to education, before the <q>sciences</q> had become formally distinct from <q>humanities</q>: the late eighteenth century saw the scientific poems of Erasmus Darwin and calls
                        for poetry that would bring zoology and botany to life and encourage sympathy with
                        the natural world.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e222" class="footnoteref" id="d2e222-ref">[11]</a></sup> We have known that the act of writing enhances learning in across disciplines for
                        a long time now. But futher, as Hermans and Alderweld point out, students can learn
                        programming more easily if they are taught in the mode of writing instruction, with
                        modeled examples and activities that hone observation skills.</p>
                     <p>It is probably no coincidence that Donald Knuth modeled his concept of <q>literate programming</q> with programming for document formatting in the 1980s. In this context the programming
                        of a machine to format electronic documents unites fundamentally with the action and
                        reproduction of writing. Knuth’s now-familiar concept seems simple in hindsight: <q>Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let

                        turn of the new millenium. In 2002 Norm Walsh modeled its application to the DocBook
                        XSLT stylesheets by applying namespaces to permit the tangling of actionable code

                        (ODD) system represents a path-breaking example of literate programming for the purpose
                        of compiling and delivering the Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) as
                        a combination of documentation and processing code instantiating the schema rules

                        processing (even within a shared vocabulary like the TEI) is the semantic naming of

                        it writerly and scholarly in nature, and gives it power as a research tool when student
                        writers learn not just how to tag but also how to manage and process their tagging
                        as a controlled system. Confronting the challenge of processing the markup and sharing
                        it with others outside one’s discourse community (oneself, one’s team, or one’s semester
                        class) is what this section designates as <span class="ital">intensive</span> about a course in writing with markup. An introductory writing experience with markup
                        languages may familiarize students with the data structure and well-formedness and

                        the writing challenge begins with confronting the management issues of writing a customization
                        and designing schema validation rules. Still more intensification is applied when
                        students learn how they can navigate and process the markup data.</p>
                     <p>This issue with writerly nature of XML coding and processing is not well appreciated
                        in the larger context of digital humanities work or the developers that surround it,
                        eager to facilitate the publication process and separate it from the markup practice.
                        There is a certain impatience manifested in the writings of developers who want to
                        federate and universalize web interfaces for transforming all bibliographic citations
                        coded in TEI, and finding this difficult or time-consuming because of distinct interpretations
                        of a coding vocabulary, proclaim the TEI itself to be the problem, as Desmond Schmidt
                        has done, for permitting all-in-one incorporation of metadata and interpretation with
                        the data of a text. Schmidt concludes that TEI is out of sync with the web of data:
                        <q>This document-centric nature of TEI contrasts with the modern data-centric world,
                           where the focus is much more on connecting relatively smaller chunks of data (Berners-Lee
                           2006).</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e316" class="footnoteref" id="d2e316-ref">[17]</a></sup>. Yet this very document-centric orientation is precisely where we should recognize
                        the liberating potential of learning to write intensively with the XML stack, that
                        is, an intellectual freedom from the workings of reductive federated processing mechanisms.
                        The mass scale interoperation that Schmidt and others presume is urgently needed for
                        digital scholarly editions (one particular kind of digital markup project) would separate
                        the scholar from the means of production because the writing of scholars will always
                        pose problems for developers who want to simplify and standardize treatment of their
                        work. Reducing all annotation to standoff triple-stores from the start would inhibit
                        scholarship because it separates the analysis of the text into machine-readable ingestions,
                        and further it presumes that one scholar’s application of the same triple-store ontology
                        will match another’s. Separating layers from the start of constructing a scholarly
                        edition project will not make the work any more objective, but there are other ways
                        to make the documentary work sharable and reviewable by means of interchange. Prioritizing
                        interoperation by separating it into packaged layers will lessen the capacity of scholars
                        who write with markup. When we consider markup as writing intensive, we should not
                        prioritize interoperation over interchange, because interoperation reduces to simple
                        commonalities and interchange explores and creates labyrinths. We need not be ashamed
                        of the XML and TEI for generating complicated structures and giving impatient developers
                        headaches. We would do better to encounter those structures as building materials
                        the way writers do, and give our students the tools to build with them. Rather than
                        designing projects primarily to suit the needs of developers or content management
                        systems, markup practitioners can learn the writing intensive way to control the developing
                        tools as their writing instruments. There will be a time and place for the content
                        management system optimized for interoperation, but this should not be the only way
                        that students and scholars learn to write with markup.</p>
                     <p>Eschewing the reduction of scholarly markup to prefabricated publication systems poses
                        inconvenience but also leads to a learning that encourages new systems of thinking
                        and gives writers access to their own means of production. The learning required takes
                        weeks, not years, and is suitably incorporated in a university semester without needing
                        specialized computing prerequisites. Such a course could take a concentration within
                        a discipline like English Literature, as Kate Singer’s class at Mount Holyoke did,
                        to concentrate collectively on constructing a digital edition of a collection of poems.
                        Singer found that the <q>broad-based ‘humanities language’ of the TEI enabled students to question, historicize,
                           and reconsider the poetic terminology we use to describe poems</q>. She and her students found that the controlled vocabulary of the TEI, in prioritizing
                        larger patterns of structure while permitting customization to the encoder of historically
                        constructed and shifting categories of poetic genre, left room for a community of
                        scholars to rethink form or apply the old constructions as they saw fit. In the context
                        of a course, that work can be excitingly experimental. The pedagogical benefit of
                        engaging students in markup and its applications was to foster decision-making, documentation,
                        and design thinking, as Singer found her students eager to take on design decisions
                        for customizing their own interface for their edition. Not only did they benefit by
                        gaining tech skills, but they also became more observant readers of poetry as well
                        as the interfaces and infrastructures of larger-scale digital scholarly editions they
                        encountered. <q>This kind of interpretive markup may, finally, give us some inkling of how TEI might
                           be used as an analytical tool for smaller-scale, case-based projects perfect for undergraduates
                           as they learn to parse and categorize their own textual situations.</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e328" class="footnoteref" id="d2e328-ref">[18]</a></sup>. Courses like these prioritize the intellectual engagement of a class with the document
                        objects they are investigating, and here the markup is clearly a research and investigation
                        tool. The markup data is more valuable than fitting it to a single uniform publication
                        framework.</p>
                     <p>The XML family of languages were designed not only to be widely accessible, but also
                        to be a vocabulary that the writer controls, consults, remixes, and transforms. It
                        does not take very long to acquaint new coders to the rules of how to tag a document,
                        or how to turn a <q>plain text</q> document into an XML document, though often people experience a little frustration
                        with typing in the attributes or figuring what they can do with attributes. The first
                        week or two of a class that involves markup methods can orient people to the basic
                        rules of well-formedness, but that quickly introduces an engaging intellectual experience
                        when we ask students to develop their own hierarchies to organize what they are reading,
                        and when we invite our students to try to recognize what is implicit, and find ways
                        to use elements, attributes, or comments to make that explicit. The act of inscribing
                        markup has been recognized as a writing process, but if it goes no further than an
                        exercise in tagging, perhaps we should consider this something like writing a reflective
                        paper, a response that sharpens one’s observation and critical thinking skills.</p>
                     <p>In my years of teaching undergraduates to code, I notice in the first couple of weeks
                        that certain students have difficulties with conceptualizing dependencies, or what
                        the relationship between an element and an attribute and its value ought to be. They
                        sometimes prepare shallow hierarchies, and instead of bundling list items together
                        in a cluster, make a very flat tree where every line is its own entry. These students
                        benefit from seeing more detailed markup, and also from understanding something about
                        how the markup may be processed, how it can be used to organize and access particular
                        kinds of information. For that reason, I have found that inviting my students to write
                        their first markup on a recipe, one that contains an interesting variety of ingredients,
                        measurement units, and activities, provides a very clear and easily recognizable sense
                        of structure with lots of categories of information. [CITE Newtfire XML EX 1] So,
                        too, does a poem, or a piece of historical correspondence. Students who have difficulty
                        constructing dependent clauses may find the preparation of an informative, non-redundant
                        hierarchy just as challenging. Quite frequently student beginners will take the text
                        content of a document and repeat it in an attribute value, as for example wrapping
                        code around a name as given in a text, and using that name in an attribute value on
                        the element, until they receive some suggestions that they might want to use the attribute
                        as a key for a standard identifier whenever this individual is mentioned by their
                        various names.</p>
                     <p>Not until we teach students how to customize, query, or transform their markup can
                        they engage with it in a way that universities would characterize as <span class="ital">writing intensive</span>. By way of reference, the Pennsylvania State University’s cross-curricular definition
                        of a writing intensive course requires that writing be used <q>to help students learn course content</q>, as well as <q>ways of writing in the discipline</q>, and that it have formal expectations delivered in assignment sheets. These expectations
                        are familiar to us from university composition courses in the requirements for research
                        papers and thesis documents with structured sections, appendices, but can also be
                        conveyed to require well-formedness in the context of markup languages and a documented
                        codebase. The most significant expectations pertinent to the current argument, however,
                        are to do with an expectation of a recursive writing process:
                        
                        <div class="blockquote">
                           <blockquote class="blockquote">

                                    </li>
                                 </ul>

                        </div>
                        What makes the markup an <span class="ital">intensive</span> writing experience is the necessity to return to it and revise it when sharing it
                        with a community of practice. When students learn to inspect the code and share its
                        customization in project teams, the markup becomes subject to intensive review and
                        systematic revision to make it be sharable rather than subjective. The more this is
                        done, and the more experience that students and scholars gain, the more prepared they
                        are to share in wider conversations, as for example, markup practitioners in the classicist
                        community share applications of the EpiDoc standard, and a medievalist graduate student
                        prepares to speak at the annual conference of the Text Encoding Initiative or at the
                        annual Kalamazoo International Congress on Medieval Studies. As with peer-reviewed
                        scholarship in any discipline, the XML code-base is subject optimally to heated debate
                        and decisions are made befitting communities of practice.</p>
                     <p>Just as we think of free-writing as a valuable exercise to start a first preliminary
                        draft in a composition class, in teaching markup, a certain amount of mess and unreliability
                        is okay as we are learning or figuring out what matters to prioritize. Often new coders
                        introduce far more differently named elements than they really need, or that would
                        be baffling to keep track of in a real-life project. To come to an understanding of
                        how to code helpfully and meaningfully, a student needs to confront the problem of
                        sharing and reproducibility—concepts parallel to the awareness of an audience emphasized
                        in rhetoric and composition classes as a means to craft better sentences, to trim
                        out verbosity.</p>
                     <p>Learning to code the XML syntax is easy. Learning to optimize one’s preparation of
                        XML takes a long time, takes practice, and takes application, just like learning to
                        write good sentences and paragraphs, and learning to develop a research paper or a
                        thesis. Just like these progressively more complex writing activities, we can identify
                        levels of intensity in increasing applications of markup technologies, and the challenges
                        to the thinking and communication process are remarkably similar. The increasing intensity
                        is not simply due to learning new technologies, but rather becomes gradually more
                        intensive in cognitive ways. The process of becoming a better reader and writer is
                        also the process of becoming more adept in organizing and processing information.
                        Writing may be easily recognizable in the practice we call mere tagging in first-time
                        coders, but the way one becomes a better writer with markup is by learning what can
                        be done with and made from the markup. The processes of navigating, extracting, transforming,
                        and remixing data marked in an XML tree define the <span class="ital">intensive</span>  part of the writing process. When students learn only tagging and do not learn how
                        to parse their own code, they remain unaware of what the markup makes possible, and
                        they may often be unaware of the problems imposed by imprecision and inconsistency.
                        They may be tagging correctly, but not in a way that communicates meaningfully or
                        reliably. Further, in becoming aware of the human unreliabilities in applying markup,
                        they may come away with the idea that the tree structures we create are subjective
                        and arbitrary, and they would be reinforced in this thinking by old arguments from
                        those who find embedded markup a source of intrusive confusion. Johanna Drucker summarizes
                        the argument from a 1999 paper by Dino Buzetti: <q>the semantic value of a text relies on reference, even though it is put directly into
                           the character string) _as if_ they are marking the plane of reference is a flawed
                           practice. Markup, in its very basis, embodies a contradiction. It collapses two distinct
                           orders of linguistic operation in a confused and messy way.</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e376" class="footnoteref" id="d2e376-ref">[20]</a></sup> This is an unfortunately binary way of thinking about embedded markup as fundamentally
                        disordered in permitting distinct semantic fields of interpretation. The location
                        of the <q>mess</q> is not so much in the orderly tree of XML as in the practice of writing human and
                        machine-readable code. This is not a matter of all embedded markup embodying contradictions,
                        but rather a matter of finding ways of imperfectly confronting a mess that can be
                        shared and found useful—the practice of embedding markup very much is the act of reading
                        and writing itself. The markup itself is only a mess to the extent that it defies
                        comprehension, navigation, and processing by an informed reader of markup. Against
                        this dismissal of markup as fundamental confusion we should counter with the concept
                        of <span class="ital">blind interchange</span>, as Syd Bauman defined it in 2011: 
                        
                        <div class="blockquote">
                           <blockquote class="blockquote">

                                 data of interest and any associated files (e.g., documentation or specifications like
                                 a TEI ODD, a METS profile, or the Balisage tag library); based on your knowledge of
                                 my data that comes from either the documents themselves or from the associated files
                                 (or both), you either change my data to suit your system or change your system to
                                 suit my data as needed. Human intervention, but not direct communication, is required.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e395" class="footnoteref" id="d2e395-ref">[21]</a></sup></p>
                           </blockquote>
                        </div> 
                        Far from posing a <q>mess</q>, the actions of documenting descriptive markup make it sustainable and sharable when
                        the encoder is removed in time and space and technological delivery system from those
                        who encounter the code. This is the benefit of the tangle and weave of literate programming,
                        and it is reinforced by communities that encounter the code and interact with it.
                        Or rather, the <q>mess</q> of markup is indistinguishable from the <q>mess</q> of writing; both may be ordered with care and explanation.</p>

                        schema code, that creates rules for encoding. This may be a first data-modeling experience
                        for students in a general education context, when they are called upon to think in
                        a <q>meta</q> or higher order reflective way about formalizing their code, and making it possible
                        for others to understand it and reproduce it.</p>

                        DOCUMENTATION and SHARING the work: establishing a context
                        When students prepare a project in markup, they are not simply writing papers to be
                        filed in a course-specific context. They are preparing a research site and their work
                        can often be continued by them or others. Students can be building beyond the constraints
                        of a single semester, and even if they are not tempted to return to the project, they
                        can leave scaffolding behind for others to continue the work or alter its direction,
                        or retrieve the files. Awareness of the potential energy of the work they are doing
                        can give shape to an encounter with markup languages in the course of a semester.
                        The energy input over a course of weeks puts emphasis on preparing material that others
                        can read and reuse. Indeed, assignments for a writing intensive experience can be
                        constructed with attention to:
                        1) reading the code and documentation of other projects, and building on it
                        2) preparing documentation meant to be read by peers and professor(s) working with
                        you, and meant to be read by others who access your code from a repository. Such documentation
                        may include:
                        * Kanban board workflow management
                        * README.md files
                        * task lists and issues
                        * being responsible and <q>on-call</q> for responding to questions and assisting your teammates
                        
                        These are activities to do with taking responsibility for method and processes, for
                        managing the intellectual content of a project. Studying how copyright applies to
                        code and markup and choosing a license for sharing the work should be part of this
                        experience. 
                        Giving students access to the full set of tools in the XML arsenal and establishing
                        both immediate (in-semester) short-range and long-range possibilities for their work
                        will introduce students from any background to the power of markup languages and with
                        the experience of writing to form and connect with communities of practice. This cannot
                        fail to be a professionalizing experience. Even in developing projects that are not
                        successful, there will be opportunities to recognize in failures what to document,
                        how to redo the work differently, how another group might start over—the project-oriented
                        awareness gives space for documentation to <q>sunset</q> the work. Whether or not students go on to use markup again after the course is over,
                        they will have engaged with a powerful form of writing that marks up, investigates,
                        curates, propagates, and conserves textual data. This is the very definition of a
                        writing-intensive experience that is both professionalizing and cross-disciplinary
                        in its reach.

                     <p>Teaching a writing-intensive course in markup modalities offers little distress for
                        adaptation to a remote learning environment. In spring 2020, when the author’s university
                        (then the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg) closed the campus and moved all
                        courses online, there was little difficulty in transferring learning materials to
                        a new format because we had already been relying on tutorials and assignments we had
                        written and posted on the web, but more importantly because we had already developed
                        a sense of community in the forms of asynchronous conversation cultivated not in the
                        learning management system but rather in GitHub and on Slack. Prior to the pandemic
                        quarantine, during January and February project teams already had developed asynchronous
                        connections, reinforced by their own emojis (a rubber duck meme associated with rubber
                        duck debugging, for example). The coding class might properly be recognized as <q>flipped</q>, in which most of the learning was already taking place in an applied context outside
                        of class, while student and faculty class meetings reviewed content all together,
                        to learn how to interact with an unfamiliar interface or to review issues students
                        are having or help address something that is not working. It was easy to continue
                        the management of a course based on markup technologies in which students had been
                        trained to work with project management tools and to be writing and sharing their
                        documentation in GitHub repositories and over Slack channels. We did miss the in-person
                        interaction on which this class relied, with instructors able to look over the shoulders
                        of students to help resolve a problem on their computers. Synchronous virtual meetings
                        could not replace this, but using screen captures in asynchronous chat became more
                        necessary, and students are certainly challenged to verbalize things that are not
                        working properly when an instructor cannot come around and see for themselves what
                        is going wrong. But adding comments to code stored in the eXist-dB and the GitHub
                        repo continued as it always had, and because this class had cultivated tools to be
                        able to communicate and work together, they were perhaps less challenged and more
                        bonded than students in the courses managed only within the learning management system.
                        Build teams of developers in a class, and a pandemic may slow but not stop them. In
                        this experience, the writing intensive nature of project development becomes especially
                        beneficial in organizing a community.</p>
