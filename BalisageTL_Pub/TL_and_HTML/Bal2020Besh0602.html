               <p>Can learning text encoding and markup languages constitute a <q>writing
                     intensive</q> experience for university students? The author is developing a
                  Text Encoding Fundamentals course with emphasis on text encoding as writing, as well
                  as a proposal that this fulfill a major state university requirement of a
                  research-oriented 300-level <q>writing intensive</q> or <q>W</q>
                  course for undergraduate students. The course is specifically
                  designed for those pursuing a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology major but must
                  also be available to others in related disciplines as an experience in <q>writing across the curriculum</q>. While we may be familiar with
                  arguments that coding and programming are a kind of literacy, the idea that
                  developing projects with markup technologies may constitute an
                  <span class="ital">intensive</span> writing experience is less familiar. The
                  consideration of text encoding as writing intensive may establish a call for
                  teaching markup technologies more widely in a cross-disciplinary context.</p>
               <p>Not just any course introducing students to markup should be considered writing
                  intensive. Arguably, a class that involves tagging exercises without project
                  development and invites students to write reflectively about the experience is not
                  engaging in an <span class="ital">intensive</span> way with the writing work we associate
                  with coding in a project development context. This paper argues that a
                  <span class="ital">writing intensive</span> course in coding should take seriously
                  the notion that coding and programming is a writing process that requires research
                  and citation, algorithmic problem-solving and decision making, task management to
                  organize a project team, and documentation to share the work and help others to
                  build upon it. A course offering such experiences should, finally, be accessible to
                  students from several disciplines, whether to a junior year English or history major
                  with little to no programming experience, or a junior year computer science or
                  information technology major with an interest in applied programming, unused to
                  research questions that drive humanities scholarship. In presenting its case, this
                  paper responds to a range of literature to evaluate the relationships among
                  <span class="ital">encoding</span>, <span class="ital">coding</span>,
                  <span class="ital">programming</span>, and <span class="ital">writing</span>.</p>

            <p>To any academic who remembers the exhilaration of writing syllabi in a markup language
               in the 1990s and posting them to a university server running the Andrew File system,
               the
               application of the phrase <q>teaching with technology</q> in the university
               discourse of the 2010s may have a jarring sound. It may seem strange to us markup
               geeks
               from a past century that <q>technology</q> for education is now entirely
               packaged and experienced in learning management systems that take care of all of our
               electronic interactions with students. To be sure, learning our way around the
               technologies driving Blackboard and Canvas is often abstruse and time-consuming,
               especially when we attempt to navigate integrations with various proprietary software
               applications like Zoom or Panopto. Publications supporting
               educational technology innovations make evident that educational software applications
               are universally expected to
               be integrated and accessed from within a learning management system (LMS). For example,
               Hypothes.is, an
               open-source technology for web annotation is now packaged and funneled into an LMS
               with
               a proprietary gradebook integration, or faculty may not be aware of its existence
               or
               understand how to apply it in their courses.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e88" class="footnoteref" id="d1e88-ref">[1]</a></sup> A group of faculty from Seton Hall university found that <q>teaching
                  with technology, can be the way to bridge perceived differences between disciplines,
                  especially at the developmental stages of a writing-across-the-curriculum
                  program</q>, and in their work to develop new technologically-enhanced courses,
               they concentrate on the interactive writing opportunities afforded by faculty’s
               encounter with a university-wide investment in a learning management system.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e97" class="footnoteref" id="d1e97-ref">[2]</a></sup> We now rely on markup-based management architectures that control university
               website delivery and our work in the <q>technology</q> of higher education is
               widely presumed to be about form-filling, at most using a limited tag set from a menu
               system. We have been acculturated to expect that classes like <q>Writing for the
                  Web</q> are and <span class="ital">should be</span> about writing in Wordpress
               templates that provide carefully constrained and little-investigated access to the
               code
               layer. <q>We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us,</q> wrote Henry
               David Thoreau, and we might as well update that for today’s university: content
               management systems organize us, we do not organize them.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e116" class="footnoteref" id="d1e116-ref">[3]</a></sup>
               </p>
            <p>Although we commit to developing course materials in frameworks that we do not choose
               for ourselves, those frameworks (e.g. Blackboard, Moodle, Canvas) are built from XML,
               which itself establishes the context of educational technology. Given universities’
               deep investment in XML-based ecosystems, can we imagine a widely-accessible cross-disciplinary
               course that inverts the relationship between code and form-box, that engages students
               and faculty in organizing ideas with markup languages that they themselves control?
               Can a sustained exploration of the markup technologies that drive our writing experience
               on the web serve as a cross-disciplinary writing-intensive experience in its own right?</p>
            <p>In awakening students to the technologies shaping composition, classes that teach
               <q>digital writing modalities</q> (or composition that involves multiple
               media forms) may provide faculty markup practitioners a well-established and widely
               lauded context for teaching markup languages in a writing-intensive way. For writing
               instructors, <q>digital writing modalities</q> or <q>multimodal
                  writing</q> can motivate dialogue about the medium as the message and the choice
               of form following function and audience. Addressing recent trends to assign student
               writing compositions in digital modalities such as audio and video, Laura Giovanelli
               and
               Molly Keener observe that <q>Well-designed pedagogy recognizes multimodal writing’s
                  potential to foster student agency and ownership as increasingly participatory
                  citizens where literacy means composing in a range of print and digital media,
                  genres, and modes, where students are consumers <span class="ital">and</span> ethical
                  creators.</q>
               <sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e142" class="footnoteref" id="d1e142-ref">[4]</a></sup> Writing with markup languages can easily be taught in the context of digital
               multimodal composition that fosters student agency and ownership of the code base.
               Much
               as students compose by remixing and ironically applying visual or auditory memes,
               they
               might apply markup languages to compose by self-consciously reordering scripts of
               official documents and develop controlled vocabularies that help communities access
               their heritage.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e153" class="footnoteref" id="d1e153-ref">[5]</a></sup> Semester-long XML-based writing-intensive courses would require access to
               good syntax-checking code editor (like the oXygen XML editor), writeable web space
               with
               secure FTP access, and possibly an XML database (like eXist-dB) and a GitHub account,
               instead of the more ubiquitous Wordpress account and the Adobe suite for the writing
               environments. While I do not expect every multimodal composition instructor to flock
               to
               these technologies, I do anticipate that those of us faculty who can teach the XML
               family of languages can do so in a way that constitutes a writing-intensive experience
               valuable to students across the curriculum, and especially valuable in programs with
               majors, minors, and certificate programs supporting the digital humanities.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most significant university context supporting university-wide
               interdisciplinary pedagogy in coding and programming, and thereby markup languages
               and
               their applications, is the call for <q>coding across the curriculum</q>, which sometimes explores the intersections between writing and coding, seeing both
               as a foundation for literacy in the twenty-first century. Following an discussion
               of programming languages as constituting both actions and descriptions, Annette Vee
               finds parallels in Kenneth Burke’s speech-act theory of human expression as performative,
               and asserts that code and programming constitutes not only a distinctly machine-actionable
               kind of writing but also is shared by human communities that support it. She finds
               code and writing inextricable from one another, and further that code extends our
               capacity for thought-processing and expression:

                  <blockquote class="blockquote">
                     <p>Since the advent of text-based programming languages, code is a form of
                        writing as well as an enactment of procedures. Now that most of our writing is done
                        with computational devices, it is no longer possible to fully extricate writing from
                        programming, just as it is impossible to untangle
                        writing from speech, or literacy from orality. Exploring the nature of
                        language, action, and expression through programming allows us to think
                        about the relationship between writing and speech differently and also to
                        consider the ways in which technologies can combine with and foster
                        human abilities. Computational and textual literacy are not simply parallel
                        abilities, but intersectional, part of a new and larger version of literacy.</p>

            <p>The XML family of languages were designed not only to be widely accessible, but also
               were designed to be a vocabulary the writer controls or consults or interacts with,
               and requires a hierarchical structuring. It does not take very long to acquaint new
               coders to the rules of how to tag a document, or how to turn a <q>plain text</q> document into an XML document, though often people experience a little frustration
               with typing in the attributes or figuring what they can do with attributes. The first
               week or two of a class that involves markup methods can orient people to how to code
               something in XML, but the interesting experience of that can be when we ask students
               to develop their own hierarchies to organize what they are reading, and when we invite
               our students to try to recognize what is implicit, and find ways to use elements,
               attributes, or comments to make that explicit. The act of inscribing markup has been
               recognized (CITE KATE SINGER) as a writing process, but if it goes no further than
               an exercise in tagging, perhaps we should consider this something like writing a reflective
               paper, a response that sharpens one’s observation and critical thinking skills. In
               my years of teaching undergraduates to code, I notice in the first couple of weeks
               that certain students have difficulties with conceptualizing dependencies, or what
               the relationship between an element and an attribute and its value ought to be. They
               sometimes prepare shallow hierarchies, and instead of bundling list items together
               in a cluster, make a very flat tree where every line is its own entry. These students
               benefit from seeing more detailed markup, and also from understanding something about
               how the markup may be processed, how it can be used to organize and access particular
               kinds of information. For that reason, I have found that inviting my students to write
               their first markup on a recipe, one that contains an interesting variety of ingredients,
               measurement units, and activities, provides a very clear and easily recognizable sense
               of structure with lots of categories of information. [CITE Newtfire XML EX 1] So,
               too, does a poem, or a piece of historical correspondence. Students who have difficulty
               constructing dependent clauses may find the preparation of an informative, non-redundant
               hierarchy just as challenging. Quite frequently student beginners will take the text
               content of a document and repeat it in an attribute value, as for example wrapping
               code around a name as given in a text, and using that name in an attribute value on
               the element, until they receive some suggestions that they might want to use the attribute
               as a key for a standard identifier whenever this individual is mentioned by their
               various names.</p>
            <p>Learning to code the XML syntax is easy. Learning to optimize one’s preparation of
               XML takes a long time, takes practice, and takes application, just like learning to
               write good sentences and paragraphs, and learning to develop a research paper or a
               thesis. Just like these progressively more complex writing activities, we can identify
               levels of intensity in increasing applications of markup technologies, and the challenges
               to the thinking and communication process are remarkably similar. The increasing intensity
               is not simply due to learning new technologies, but rather becomes gradually more
               intensive in cognitive ways. The process of becoming a better reader and writer and
               coder and developer is also the process of becoming more adept in organizing and processing
               information. Writing may be easily recognizable in the practice we call mere tagging
               in first-time coders, but the way one becomes a better writer with markup is by learning
               what can be done with and made from the markup. The processes of navigating, extracting,
               transforming, and remixing data marked in an XML tree define the <span class="ital">intensive</span>  part of the writing process. When students learn only tagging and do not learn how
               to parse their own code, they remain unaware of what the markup makes possible, and
               they may often be unaware of the problems imposed by imprecision and inconsistency.
               They may be tagging correctly, but not in a way that communicates meaningfully or
               reliably. Worse yet, in becoming aware of the human unreliabilities in applying markup,
               they may come away with the idea that the tree structures we create are arbitrary,
               exert an aggressive control over a document. [CITE] This line of thinking relies on
               an unsustained, non-intensive engagement with marked documents and an unfortunate
               separation of the technologies of managing and processing XML from instruction in
               markup.</p>
            <p>Just as we think of free-writing as a valuable exercise to start a first preliminary
               draft in a composition class, in teaching markup, a certain amount of mess and unreliability
               is okay as we are learning or figuring out what matters to prioritize. Often new coders
               introduce far more differently named elements than they really need, or that would
               be baffling to keep track of in a real-life project. To come to an understanding of
               how to code helpfully and meaningfully, a student needs to confront the problem of
               sharing and reproducibility—concepts parallel to the awareness of an audience emphasized
               in rhetoric and composition classes as a means to craft better sentences, to trim
               out verbosity.</p>
            <p>Students often improve their markup dramatically when they learn to write Relax NG
               schema code, that creates rules for encoding. This may be a first data-modeling experience
               for students in a general education context, when they are called upon to think in
               a <q>meta</q> or higher order reflective way about formalizing their code, and making it possible
               for others to understand it and reproduce it.</p>

               CITE: Clifford Anderson's Balisage paper: On Teaching XQuery to Digital Humanists:
               <q>XQuery makes it possible for students to become productive without having to learn
                  as many computer science or software engineering concepts. A simple four or five line
                  FLWOR expression can easily demonstrate the power of XQuery and provide a basis for
                  students' tinkering and exploration.</q> And, as Anderson affirms, it is part of a full stack development  http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol13/html/Anderson01/BalisageVol13-Anderson01.html
               
               DOCUMENTATION and SHARING the work: establishing a context
               When students prepare a project in markup, they are not simply writing papers to be
               filed in a course-specific context. They are preparing a research site and their work
               can often be continued by them or others. Students can be building beyond the constraints
               of a single semester, and even if they are not tempted to return to the project, they
               can leave scaffolding behind for others to continue the work or alter its direction,
               or retrieve the files. Awareness of the potential energy of the work they are doing
               can give shape to an encounter with markup languages in the course of a semester.
               The energy input over a course of weeks puts emphasis on preparing material that others
               can read and reuse. Indeed, assignments for a writing intensive experience can be
               constructed with attention to:
               1) reading the code and documentation of other projects, and building on it
               2) preparing documentation meant to be read by peers and professor(s) working with
               you, and meant to be read by others who access your code from a repository. Such documentation
               may include:
               * Kanban board workflow management
               * README.md files
               * task lists and issues
               * being responsible and <q>on-call</q> for responding to questions and assisting your teammates
               
               These are activities to do with taking responsibility for method and processes, for
               managing the intellectual content of a project. Studying how copyright applies to
               code and markup and choosing a license for sharing the work should be part of this
               experience. 
               Giving students access to the full set of tools in the XML arsenal and establishing
               both immediate (in-semester) short-range and long-range possibilities for their work
               will introduce students from any background to the power of markup languages and with
               the experience of writing to form and connect with communities of practice. This cannot
               fail to be a professionalizing experience. Even in developing projects that are not
               successful, there will be opportunities to recognize in failures what to document,
               how to redo the work differently, how another group might start over—the project-oriented
               awareness gives space for documentation to <q>sunset</q> the work. Whether or not students go on to use markup again after the course is over,
               they will have engaged with a powerful form of writing that marks up, investigates,
               curates, propagates, and conserves textual data. This is the very definition of a
               writing-intensive experience that is both professionalizing and cross-disciplinary
               in its reach.

               (documentation, XML Comments, git commits, methodology pages, sharing the work with
               others)
               (research in the field: referencing is connecting and networking)
               
               
               CUT: YOUR GOAL ISN'T TO MAKE EVERYBODY DO THIS, BUT JUST TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN IT
               IS TAUGHT IT OUGHT TO BE RECOGNIZED AND CREDITED AS WRITING INTENSIVE.
               How hard is this for Humanities faculty to learn? 
               Faculty workshops and training can provide it, but it is not often offered, and perhaps
               we need to overcome a presumption that faculty will not be interested in the material.
               Where do we markup practitioners imagine that we find an audience for instructional
               materials? Who should be learning these technologies? Can this be treated not <span class="ital">only</span> as a restricted technological preserve, but as an encounter with what digital texts
               can be made of, as a component of digital literacy for humanities faculty and graduate
               programs? Can we encourage and incentivize the learning, teaching, and sharing of
               these technologies? The author learned enough of a foundation in a range of languages
               in a 15-week semester thanks to the existence of a course taught by David J. Birnbaum
               in the University of Pittsburgh’s Honors College program CITE, and she learned alongside
               a group of undergraduates, working in teams on semester projects as described in this
               paper. While she took the course to learn how to develop a digital edition project,
               she exited with the basis for developing new courses and imagining new ways of working
               on projects with students. Other faculty at Pitt and Pitt-Greensburg have lit their
               torches from the same pedagogical fires, and we are aware of faculty at UVic, U of
               Maryland, Bucknell, and Vanderbilt (just to name a few) who teach humanities students
               to engage with a range of XML technologies. 
               
               Teaching Markup Languages during a Pandemic
               Teaching a writing-intensive course in markup modalities offers little distress for
               adaptation to a remote learning environment, as we had to do recently after the university
               closed down face-to-face classes. This kind of class works for connecting synchronously
               OR asynchronously. It was much easier to continue the management of a course based
               on markup technologies in which students had been trained to work with project management
               tools and to be writing and sharing their documentation in GitHub repositories and
               over Slack channels than to retool one in which in-class daily discussion and traditional
               kinds of assignments prevailed. The digital modalities organizing our class were lively
               enough that the coding class might properly be recognized as <q>flipped</q>, in which most of the learning was already taking place in an applied context outside
               of class, while student and faculty class meetings reviewed content all together,
               to learn how to interact with an unfamiliar interface or to review issues students
               are having or help address something that is not working.
