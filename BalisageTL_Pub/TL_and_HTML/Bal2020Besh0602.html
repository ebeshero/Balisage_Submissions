                        <p>Can learning text encoding and markup languages constitute a <q>writing
                              intensive</q> experience for university students? The author is developing a
                           Text Encoding Fundamentals course with emphasis on text encoding as writing, as well
                           as a proposal that this fulfill a major state university requirement of a
                           research-oriented 300-level <q>writing intensive</q> or <q>W</q>
                           course for undergraduate students. The course is specifically designed for those
                           pursuing a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology major but must also be available to
                           others in related disciplines as an experience in <q>writing across the
                              curriculum</q>. While we may be familiar with arguments that coding and
                           programming are a kind of literacy, the idea that developing projects with markup
                           technologies may constitute an <span class="ital">intensive</span> writing experience is
                           less familiar. The consideration of text encoding as writing intensive may establish
                           a call for teaching markup technologies more widely in a cross-disciplinary
                           context.</p>
                        <p>Not just any course introducing students to markup should be considered writing
                           intensive. Arguably, a class that involves tagging exercises without project
                           development and invites students to write reflectively about the experience is not
                           engaging in an <span class="ital">intensive</span> way with the writing work we associate
                           with coding in a project development context. This paper argues that a
                           <span class="ital">writing intensive</span> course in coding should take seriously
                           the notion that coding and programming is a writing process that requires research
                           and citation, algorithmic problem-solving and decision making, task management to
                           organize a project team, and documentation to share the work and help others to
                           build upon it. A course offering such experiences should, finally, be accessible to
                           students from several disciplines, whether to a junior year English or history major
                           with little to no programming experience, or a junior year computer science or
                           information technology major with an interest in applied programming, unused to
                           research questions that drive humanities scholarship. In presenting its case, this
                           paper explores a range of literature to locate intersections between digital writing
                           modalities discussed in the context of composition courses and the concept of
                           literate programming that grounds the XML family of languages.</p>

                     <p>To any academic who remembers the exhilaration in the 1990s of navigating around an
                        Andrew File System and posting on it a <q>paperless syllabus</q> in a markup
                        language, the application of the phrase <q>teaching with technology</q> in the
                        university discourse of the 2010s may have a jarring sound. Scholarly markup geeks
                        from
                        a past century have lived to see <q>technology</q> for education be packaged in
                        learning management systems that securely take care of all of our electronic
                        interactions with students from posting announcements to grades. Even for 90s markup
                        geeks, learning our way around the technologies driving Blackboard and Canvas can
                        be
                        abstruse and fretfully time-consuming, especially when we attempt applying their
                        byzantine integrations with various proprietary software applications like Zoom or
                        Panopto. Publications supporting educational technology innovations make evident that
                        educational software applications are universally expected to be integrated and accessed
                        from within a learning management system (LMS). For example, Hypothes.is, an open-source
                        technology for web annotation is now packaged and funneled into an LMS with a
                        proprietary gradebook integration, or faculty may not be aware of its existence or
                        understand how to apply it in their courses.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e76" class="footnoteref" id="d2e76-ref">[1]</a></sup> A group of faculty from Seton Hall university found that <q>teaching
                           with technology, can be the way to bridge perceived differences between disciplines,
                           especially at the developmental stages of a writing-across-the-curriculum
                           program</q>, and in their work to develop new technologically-enhanced courses,
                        they concentrate on the interactive writing opportunities afforded by faculty’s
                        encounter with a university-wide investment in a learning management system.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e86" class="footnoteref" id="d2e86-ref">[2]</a></sup> We now rely on markup-based management architectures that control university
                        website delivery and our work in the <q>technology</q> of higher education is
                        widely presumed to be about form-filling, at most using a limited tag set from a menu
                        system. We have been acculturated to expect that composition and digital media classes
                        like <q>Writing for the Web</q> are and <span class="ital">should be</span> about
                        writing in Wordpress templates that provide carefully constrained and
                        little-investigated access to the code layer. <q>We do not ride on the railroad; it
                           rides upon us,</q> wrote Henry David Thoreau, and we might as well update that
                        for today’s university content management systems: we do not direct the content

                     <p>Although we have little practical choice but to commit to developing course materials
                        in frameworks that we do not choose for ourselves, those frameworks (e.g. Blackboard,
                        Moodle, Canvas) are built from XML building blocks which the savvy customer can
                        occasionally learn about to try to modify parts of the system permissible to access.

                        institutions, but the way in which we access it is carefully gated in ways that benefit
                        us but also relegate the technology under the hood to the level of the abstruse and
                        esoteric. Those of us who teach students to write and build projects with markup
                        technologies may be few in number, but we are the ones who are aware of the skills
                        our
                        students rapidly develop and hone over the course of a single semester—skills to build
                        data models, a search interfaces, and informational graphics according to their own
                        design and not funnelled through one or two particular brands of software. Learning
                        XML
                        with its family of languages helps students to develop independently from <q>black
                           box</q> software, and also helps make them informed consumers to choose the
                        software they want to commit to particular tasks, to find the software most amenable
                        to
                        user alterations <q>under the hood</q> and most friendly to transporting the
                        data when the software does not last. Learning markup technologies is a way of learning
                        the structures of the web of information, and much the way we learn to write with
                        and
                        against the formal genre expectations of an essay or a poem, we learn formal ways
                        of
                        containing data and relating metadata in an XML framework in ways that are influenced
                        by
                        our interests in processing, sharing, accessing the data. We write things that be
                        read
                        and acted upon by humans; and we write markup to be read and parsed and acted upon
                        by
                        humans and machines.</p>
                     <p>XML markup and its family of languages itself has not become more abstruse or
                        difficult to learn since the millenium. Indeed, instruction is much easier now with
                        many
                        tutorials available and more powerful processing methods available now.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e133" class="footnoteref" id="d2e133-ref">[5]</a></sup> However, the learning of markup technologies and the XML stack has been
                        cultivated too narrowly to be recognized as a general skillset beneficial to students
                        across disciplines. Given universities’ deep investment in XML-based ecosystems, can
                        we
                        imagine a widely-accessible cross-disciplinary course that inverts the relationship
                        between code and form-box, that engages students and faculty in organizing ideas with
                        markup languages that they themselves control? This paper argues that a sustained
                        learning and application of markup technologies, not as implicit structure, but as
                        explicit document data modeling and development, should serve as a broadly accessible
                        cross-disciplinary writing-intensive experience in its own right. This exploration
                        should open doors to students who would otherwise not consider themselves <q>tech

                        as students compose by remixing and ironically applying visual or auditory memes,
                        they
                        might apply markup languages to compose by self-consciously reordering scripts of
                        official documents and develop controlled vocabularies that help communities access

                        their applications, is the call for <q>coding across the curriculum</q>, which
                        sometimes explores the intersections between writing and coding, seeing both as a
                        foundation for literacy in the twenty-first century. Programming is sometimes described
                        as a specifically actionable kind of language, or a language that combines both actions
                        and descriptions, and for this Annette Vee finds parallels in Kenneth Burke’s speech-act
                        theory of human expression as performative. Vee finds that coding and programming

                        a distinctly machine-actionable kind of writing in a language shared by human

                                 writing as well as an enactment of procedures. Now that most of our writing is
                                 done with computational devices, it is no longer possible to fully extricate
                                 writing from programming, just as it is impossible to untangle writing from

                                 expression through programming allows us to think about the relationship between

                        explicit when we think of it on the same terms as developing language skills. Coding
                        should be as ubiquitous and familiar to students as the writing they have been learning
                        since childhood. Coding does not belong to computer science departments any more than
                        writing belongs to English departments, as David J. Birnbaum and Alison Langmead make
                        explicit:

                        in computer science if they learned to program in a way that followed models for
                        learning to write. They suggest that programming instruction would be improved if
                        it
                        adapted the way writing instructors model examples of their writing process for students
                        to break it down into discrete tasks more efficiently. They cite a study in which

                        elementary students comprehended scientific concepts better when they were assigned
                        short writing assignments that engaged the topic. The suggestion that writing

                        makes the material more widely accessible and <q>could help a broader group of kids

                        had become formally distinct from <q>humanities</q>: the late eighteenth century
                        saw the scientific poems of Erasmus Darwin and calls for poetry that would bring zoology

                        some
                        of the issues of transformation and sharing the data, but intensification of the writing
                        challenge begins with confronting the management issues of writing a customization
                        and
                        designing schema validation rules. Still more intensification is applied when students
                        learn how they can navigate and process the markup data.</p>
                     <p>This issue with writerly nature of XML coding and processing is not well appreciated
                        in the larger context of digital humanities work or the developers that surround it,
                        eager to facilitate the publication process and separate it from the markup practice.
                        There is a certain impatience manifested in the writings of developers who want to
                        federate and universalize web interfaces for transforming all bibliographic citations
                        coded in TEI, and finding this difficult or time-consuming because of distinct
                        interpretations of a coding vocabulary, proclaim the TEI itself to be the problem,
                        as
                        Desmond Schmidt has done, for permitting all-in-one incorporation of metadata and
                        interpretation with the data of a text. Schmidt concludes that TEI is out of sync
                        with
                        the web of data: <q>This document-centric nature of TEI contrasts with the modern
                           data-centric world, where the focus is much more on connecting relatively smaller
                           chunks of data (Berners-Lee 2006).</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e316" class="footnoteref" id="d2e316-ref">[17]</a></sup>. Yet this very document-centric orientation is precisely where we should
                        recognize the liberating potential of learning to write intensively with the XML stack,
                        that is, an intellectual freedom from the workings of reductive federated processing
                        mechanisms. The mass scale interoperation that Schmidt and others presume is urgently
                        needed for digital scholarly editions (one particular kind of digital markup project)
                        would separate the scholar from the means of production because the writing of scholars
                        will always pose problems for developers who want to simplify and standardize treatment
                        of their work. Reducing all annotation to standoff triple-stores from the start would
                        inhibit scholarship because it separates the analysis of the text into machine-readable
                        ingestions, and further it presumes that one scholar’s application of the same
                        triple-store ontology will match another’s. Separating layers from the start of
                        constructing a scholarly edition project will not make the work any more objective,
                        but
                        there are other ways to make the documentary work sharable and reviewable by means
                        of
                        interchange. Prioritizing interoperation by separating it into packaged layers will
                        lessen the capacity of scholars who write with markup. When we consider markup as
                        writing intensive, we should not prioritize interoperation over interchange, because
                        interoperation reduces to simple commonalities and interchange explores and creates
                        labyrinths. We need not be ashamed of the XML and TEI for generating complicated
                        structures and giving impatient developers headaches. We would do better to encounter
                        those structures as building materials the way writers do, and give our students the
                        tools to build with them. Rather than designing projects primarily to suit the needs
                        of
                        developers or content management systems, markup practitioners can learn the writing
                        intensive way to control the developing tools as their writing instruments. There
                        will
                        be a time and place for the content management system optimized for interoperation,
                        but
                        this should not be the only way that students and scholars learn to write with
                        markup.</p>
                     <p>Eschewing the reduction of scholarly markup to prefabricated publication systems poses
                        inconvenience but also leads to a learning that encourages new systems of thinking
                        and
                        gives writers access to their own means of production. The learning required takes
                        weeks, not years, and is suitably incorporated in a university semester without needing
                        specialized computing prerequisites. Such a course could take a concentration within
                        a
                        discipline like English Literature, as Kate Singer’s class at Mount Holyoke did, to
                        concentrate collectively on constructing a digital edition of a collection of poems.
                        Singer found that the <q>broad-based ‘humanities language’ of the TEI enabled
                           students to question, historicize, and reconsider the poetic terminology we use to
                           describe poems</q>. She and her students found that the controlled vocabulary of
                        the TEI, in prioritizing larger patterns of structure while permitting customization
                        to
                        the encoder of historically constructed and shifting categories of poetic genre, left
                        room for a community of scholars to rethink form or apply the old constructions as
                        they
                        saw fit. In the context of a course, that work can be excitingly experimental. The
                        pedagogical benefit of engaging students in markup and its applications was to foster
                        decision-making, documentation, and design thinking, as Singer found her students
                        eager
                        to take on design decisions for customizing their own interface for their edition.
                        Not
                        only did they benefit by gaining tech skills, but they also became more observant
                        readers of poetry as well as the interfaces and infrastructures of larger-scale digital
                        scholarly editions they encountered. <q>This kind of interpretive markup may,
                           finally, give us some inkling of how TEI might be used as an analytical tool for
                           smaller-scale, case-based projects perfect for undergraduates as they learn to parse
                           and categorize their own textual situations.</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e328" class="footnoteref" id="d2e328-ref">[18]</a></sup>. Courses like these prioritize the intellectual engagement of a class with
                        the document objects they are investigating, and here the markup is clearly a research
                        and investigation tool. The markup data is more valuable than fitting it to a single
                        uniform publication framework.</p>
                     <p>The XML family of languages were designed not only to be widely accessible, but also
                        to be a vocabulary that the writer controls, consults, remixes, and transforms. It
                        does
                        not take very long to acquaint new coders to the rules of how to tag a document, or
                        how
                        to turn a <q>plain text</q> document into an XML document, though often people
                        experience a little frustration with typing in the attributes or figuring what they
                        can
                        do with attributes. The first week or two of a class that involves markup methods
                        can
                        orient people to the basic rules of well-formedness, but that quickly introduces an
                        engaging intellectual experience when we ask students to develop their own hierarchies
                        to organize what they are reading, and when we invite our students to try to recognize
                        what is implicit, and find ways to use elements, attributes, or comments to make that
                        explicit. The act of inscribing markup has been recognized as a writing process, but
                        if
                        it goes no further than an exercise in tagging, perhaps we should consider this
                        something like writing a reflective paper, a response that sharpens one’s observation
                        and critical thinking skills.</p>
                     <p>In my years of teaching undergraduates to code, I notice in the first couple of weeks
                        that certain students have difficulties with conceptualizing dependencies, or what
                        the
                        relationship between an element and an attribute and its value ought to be. They
                        sometimes prepare shallow hierarchies, and instead of bundling list items together
                        in a
                        cluster, make a very flat tree where every line is its own entry. These students benefit
                        from seeing more detailed markup, and also from understanding something about how
                        the
                        markup may be processed, how it can be used to organize and access particular kinds
                        of
                        information. For that reason, I have found that inviting my students to write their
                        first markup on a recipe, one that contains an interesting variety of ingredients,
                        measurement units, and activities, provides a very clear and easily recognizable sense
                        of structure with lots of categories of information. Further, I ask them to envision
                        a
                        scenario for the encoding that tries to create a system for filing documents: 
                        <div class="blockquote">
                           <blockquote class="blockquote">
                              <p>First, read this recipe for homemade bread, and pretend you are filing it with
                                 hundreds of other recipes that you need to fit a set purpose, such as running a
                                 restaurant, in which you need to keep track of kinds and quantities of
                                 ingredients required. XML is written to store information, and when we apply it
                                 to a situation with numbers and units, like with coding recipes, the code we
                                 write can help make computerized calculations, and help optimize searching
                                 across a collection for particular kinds of ingredients. Your code might be
                                 designed to help categorize ingredients by what part of the grocery store they
                                 can be found in. The challenge of the assignment is to write code that helps
                                 categorize ingredients, mark necessary equipment, and stages for processing, but
                                 the system you develop is up to you.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e349" class="footnoteref" id="d2e349-ref">[19]</a></sup></p>
                           </blockquote>
                        </div> Moving to the encoding of a poem or a piece of historical correspondence
                        after the recipe leads to recognition of different kinds of data and observations
                        about
                        the formal dimensions and organization of patterns, as well as the interest in
                        referencing different kinds of information like names, dates, people, and places,
                        as
                        well as images, motifs, rhyme. Quite frequently student beginners will take the text
                        content of a document and repeat it in an attribute value, as for example wrapping
                        code
                        around a name as given in a text, and using that name in an attribute value on the
                        element, until they receive some suggestions that they might want to use the attribute
                        as a key for a standard identifier whenever this individual is mentioned by their
                        various names. Students who have difficulty constructing dependent clauses may find
                        the
                        preparation of an informative, non-redundant hierarchy just as challenging as their
                        composition courses, and while their first efforts are observably messy, they can
                        be
                        discussed in terms of how to simplify if one were to prepare a large collection and
                        wanted to work systematically with a particularly interesting and tractable kind of
                        data. </p>
                     <p>Not until we teach students how to customize, query, or transform their markup can
                        they engage with it in a way that universities would characterize as <span class="ital">writing
                           intensive</span>. By way of reference, the Pennsylvania State University’s
                        cross-curricular definition of a writing intensive course requires that writing be
                        used
                        <q>to help students learn course content</q>, as well as <q>ways of
                           writing in the discipline</q>, and that it have formal expectations delivered in
                        assignment sheets. These expectations are familiar to us from university composition
                        courses in the requirements for research papers and thesis documents with structured
                        sections, appendices, but can also be conveyed to require well-formedness in the context
                        of markup languages and a documented codebase. The most significant expectations
                        pertinent to the current argument, however, are to do with an expectation of a recursive
                        writing process: 
                        <div class="blockquote">
                           <blockquote class="blockquote">

                        </div> What makes the markup an <span class="ital">intensive</span> writing experience
                        is the necessity to return to it and revise it when sharing it with a community of
                        practice. When students learn to inspect the code and share its customization in project
                        teams, the markup becomes subject to intensive review and systematic revision to make
                        it
                        be sharable rather than subjective. The more this is done, and the more experience
                        that
                        students and scholars gain, the more prepared they are to share in wider conversations,
                        as for example, markup practitioners in the classicist community share applications
                        of
                        the EpiDoc standard, and a medievalist graduate student prepares to speak at the annual
                        conference of the Text Encoding Initiative or at the annual Kalamazoo International
                        Congress on Medieval Studies. As with peer-reviewed scholarship in any discipline,
                        the
                        XML code-base is subject optimally to heated debate and decisions are made befitting
                        communities of practice.</p>
                     <p>Just as we think of free-writing as a valuable exercise to start a first preliminary
                        draft in a composition class, in teaching markup, a certain amount of mess and
                        unreliability is okay as we are learning or figuring out what matters to prioritize.
                        Often new coders introduce far more differently named elements than they really need,
                        or
                        that would be baffling to keep track of in a real-life project. To come to an
                        understanding of how to code helpfully and meaningfully, a student needs to confront
                        the
                        problem of sharing and reproducibility—concepts parallel to the awareness of an audience
                        emphasized in rhetoric and composition classes as a means to craft better sentences,
                        to
                        trim out verbosity.</p>
                     <p>Learning to code the XML syntax is easy. Learning to optimize one’s preparation of
                        XML
                        takes guided practice, just like learning to write good sentences and paragraphs,
                        and
                        learning to develop a research paper or a thesis. Just like these progressively more
                        complex writing activities, we can identify levels of intensity in increasing
                        applications of markup technologies, and the challenges to the thinking and
                        communication process are remarkably similar. The increasing intensity is not simply
                        due
                        to learning new technologies, but rather becomes gradually more intensive in cognitive
                        ways. The process of becoming a better reader and writer is also the process of becoming
                        more adept in organizing and processing information. Writing may be easily recognizable
                        in the practice we call mere tagging in first-time coders, but the way one becomes
                        a
                        better writer with markup is by learning what can be done with and made from the markup.
                        The processes of navigating, extracting, transforming, and remixing data marked in
                        an
                        XML tree define the <span class="ital">intensive</span> part of the writing process. When
                        students learn only tagging and do not learn how to parse their own code, they remain
                        unaware of what the markup makes possible, and they may often be unaware of the problems
                        imposed by imprecision and inconsistency. They may be tagging correctly, but not in
                        a
                        way that communicates meaningfully or reliably. Further, in becoming aware of the
                        human
                        unreliabilities in applying markup, they may come away with the idea that the tree
                        structures we create are subjective and arbitrary, and they would be reinforced in
                        this
                        thinking by old arguments from those who find embedded markup a source of intrusive
                        confusion. Johanna Drucker summarizes the argument from a 1999 paper by Dino Buzetti:
                        <q>the semantic value of a text relies on reference, even though it is put
                           directly into the character string) <span class="ital">as if</span> they are marking the
                           plane of reference is a flawed practice. Markup, in its very basis, embodies a
                           contradiction. It collapses two distinct orders of linguistic operation in a
                           confused and messy way.</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e395" class="footnoteref" id="d2e395-ref">[21]</a></sup> This is an unfortunately binary way of thinking about embedded markup as
                        fundamentally disordered in permitting distinct semantic fields of interpretation.
                        The
                        location of the <q>mess</q> is not so much in the orderly tree of XML as in the
                        practice of writing human and machine-readable code. This is not a matter of all
                        embedded markup embodying contradictions, but rather a matter of finding ways of
                        imperfectly confronting a mess that can be shared and found useful—the practice of
                        embedding markup very much is the act of reading and writing itself. The markup itself
                        is only a mess to the extent that it defies comprehension, navigation, and processing
                        by
                        an informed reader of markup. Against this dismissal of markup as fundamental confusion
                        we should counter with the concept of <span class="ital">blind interchange</span>, as Syd
                        Bauman defined it in 2011: 
                        <div class="blockquote">
                           <blockquote class="blockquote">

                                 the data of interest and any associated files (e.g., documentation or
                                 specifications like a TEI ODD, a METS profile, or the Balisage tag library);
                                 based on your knowledge of my data that comes from either the documents
                                 themselves or from the associated files (or both), you either change my data to
                                 suit your system or change your system to suit my data as needed. Human
                                 intervention, but not direct communication, is required.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e414" class="footnoteref" id="d2e414-ref">[22]</a></sup></p>
                           </blockquote>
                        </div> Far from posing a <q>mess</q>, the actions of documenting
                        descriptive markup make it sustainable and sharable when the encoder is removed in
                        time
                        and space and technological delivery system from those who encounter the code. This
                        is
                        the benefit of the tangle and weave of literate programming, and it is reinforced
                        by
                        communities that encounter the code and interact with it. Or rather, the
                        <q>mess</q> of markup is indistinguishable from the <q>mess</q> of
                        writing; both may be ordered with care and explanation.</p>
                     <p>Students often improve their markup dramatically when they learn to write Relax NG
                        schema code, that creates rules for encoding. This may be a first data-modeling
                        experience for students in a general education context, when they are called upon
                        to
                        think in a <q>meta</q> or higher order reflective way about formalizing their
                        code, and making it possible for others to understand it and reproduce it. Learning
                        to
                        write schema code and learning to navigate and parse the markup also leads to writing
                        comments to explain decisions and document the code.</p>
                     <p>Because the XML family of languages is amenable to rapid learning, a student can
                        become a <q>stack developer</q> easily in the course of a semester, as Clifford
                        Anderson observed of the course he taught students in XQuery: <q>XQuery makes it
                           possible for students to become productive without having to learn as many computer
                           science or software engineering concepts. A simple four or five line FLWOR
                           expression can easily demonstrate the power of XQuery and provide a basis for
                           students' tinkering and exploration.</q><sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e440" class="footnoteref" id="d2e440-ref">[23]</a></sup> Further, learning to process markup leads code-writers to a decision making
                        process about streamlining the code-base, making it more legible, tractable, XPath-able.
                        The more XPath people learn, the better equipped they are to understand the actionable
                        aspects of the code they have created. Learning XPath and writing XSLT or XQuery moves
                        a
                        coder from following rules obediently so that others can process the data, to becoming
                        an active intellectual investigator.</p>

                        projects</h2>
                     <p>University students can and do create projects <q>built to last</q>, that is,
                        launched in a way that others can build on and continue based on the documentation
                        they
                        provide. As a case in point, let us consider two markup projects, decades apart,
                        addressing the poetry of Emily Dickinson.</p>
                     <p>The first is a proof-of-concept proposal for a PhD thesis prepared by then graduate
                        student at University of Virginia, Michele Ierardi, and as of 2020, it is now only
                        accessible on the web from the Wayback Machine: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191014042502/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~ajf2j/emily/stab.html" class="link" target="_new">Translating Emily: Digitally Re-Presenting Fascicle 16</a>.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e463" class="footnoteref" id="d2e463-ref">[24]</a></sup> The project involved an exercise in HTML 1.0 and an early form of JavaScript
                        to render Emily Dickinson’s handwritten variants on her own poems in a way that did
                        not
                        demote those variants to a footnote, but gave them equal space using the capacities
                        of
                        hypertext. On reading a Dickinson’s poems on the site, the reader would encounter
                        Dickinson’s own different versions of a line in slowly flashing text. The editor’s
                        hope
                        in designing her interface was to make readers more aware of Dickinson’s open-endedness,
                        in not cancelling out multiple versions of a line, that all possibilities could coexist.
                        The site was a proof of concept that did not materialize into a PhD thesis project,
                        but
                        it persisted and influenced my teaching of American Literature courses when I wanted
                        to
                        share Dickinson’s unusual writing process with my students and give them an experience
                        of an interesting and accessible (if slightly hypnotizing) digital edition interface.
                        The JavaScript on the site ceased to function around 2010, and soon thereafter I began
                        seeking a way to continue accessing this cleanly and simply encoded project in a way
                        that would still benefit my students.</p>
                     <p>In 2015, soon after I had begun teaching courses in coding and the XML stack at
                        Pitt-Greensburg, I was fortunate to find a group of students interested in poetry
                        and
                        fascinated by the possibilities of digital archive recovery work. The students and
                        I
                        contacted Michele Ierardi and obtained her permission to reconstruct her site. This
                        involved up-converting the code from HTML 1.0 to TEI P5, as well as adding more data
                        researched and supplied by my students to include TEI critical apparatus markup that
                        would encode Dickinson’s variants as well as other printed versions of the same poems
                        in
                        a series of editions published after Dickinson’s death. Their new goal was to build
                        on
                        Ierardi’s work and create a readable interface for comparing the multiple versions
                        of
                        Dickinson’s poems, and to begin expanding that work to include other fascicles (the
                        term
                        for the bundles of poems that Dickinson tied together with thread). My students’ site
                        is
                        the second <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/" class="link" target="_new">Emily Dickinson
                           project</a>, strongly bound to the first.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e478" class="footnoteref" id="d2e478-ref">[25]</a></sup> These students have since graduated, but they continue to work on this
                        project, adding a new fascicle and tinkering with the interface, and I understand
                        from
                        the ongoing project director, Nicole Lottig, that she intends to continue coding and
                        developing the site to display all of Dickinson’s fascicles as a long-term project.
                        An
                        excellent sampling of the project’s interface for reading a Dickinson poem and seeing
                        its variant texts and images together is its display of <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/16/1605.html" class="link" target="_new">Poem 1605</a>, which
                        shows how most of the early print editions cut out Dickinson’s entire last stanza
                        and
                        typically ignored her variants. The editors share <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/16/xml/1605variant.xml" class="link" target="_new">their TEI code
                           from the interface</a>, which provides an application of parallel segmentation in
                        the TEI.</p>
                     <p>In preparing this project, the students had the benefit of building on an earlier
                        and
                        simpler markup model, as well as a sense of purpose in giving a remarkably interesting
                        project a new lease on life. They needed to study the TEI P5 guidelines and essentially
                        took a <q>crash course</q>, as undergraduates from a range of majors in English,
                        Creative Writing, and Information Sciences in manuscript encoding and textual
                        scholarship, in the course of a semester. They learned to transform the code and
                        designed the interface in the Fall 2015 semester, and then redesigned and improved
                        the
                        interface while investigating a new research question in a following Spring 2016 term.
                        Over the course of one year, in the context of university coursework, this site took
                        wings, not just as a way to read the documents, but also to investigate and visualize
                        a
                        serious research question of how these editions compare to one another. Writing XSLT
                        and
                        XQuery on the project, these students produced SVG visualizations of <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/16/dash.html" class="link" target="_new"><q>Comparative Dash
                              Reduction</q></a> (measuring which editions most frequently normalized
                        Dickinson’s dash punctuation into commas, semicolons, or periods), and <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/16/networkAnalysis.html" class="link" target="_new">a network
                           analysis</a> to investigate which editions share the most variants in common.
                        This was created with XQuery to pull and calculate data from the TEI parallel
                        segmentation markup: For each instance of critical apparatus markup, study the
                        co-occurrence of particular witnesses. Generate a count of the number of times each
                        witness appears with each of the other witnesses. This data was pulled as a simple
                        TSV
                        (tab-separated values file) and plotted in Cytoscape network analysis software.</p>
                     <p>The student website documents its methodology extensively and I now use it as a model
                        for my current students to prepare documentation that <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/16/conclusion.html" class="link" target="_new">features code and
                           coding decisions</a>. Along the way of producing it and sustaining their
                        codebase, the project team cultivated <a href="http://dickinson.newtfire.org/contact.html" class="link" target="_new">multiple GitHub repositories
                           with issue tracking</a> as they turned to new sources of data and worked to
                        combine Fascicles 6 and 16 into a new site. Their writing intensive experience involved
                        countless messages to each other to fix broken code, make a visualization work, update
                        the website, refine the CSS and JavaScript. The professional experience with web
                        development was took them far beyond what would be possible in a course in tagging
                        and
                        markup alone, or in web development within a content management system. The writing
                        intensive part was unquestionably in producing and testing and refining their own
                        interface. And the project keeps on giving to future students.</p>
                     <p>In Fall 2019, a colleague of mine from the History department, Bill Campbell, did
                        me
                        the great honor of taking my coding course, following a tradition at Pitt begun when
                        I
                        took David Birnbaum’s XML-stack coding course on Obdurodon in Spring 2013.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d2e514" class="footnoteref" id="d2e514-ref">[26]</a></sup>. Campbell launched <a href="http://brecon.newtfire.org" class="link" target="_new">The Brecon
                           Project</a>, together with students on his team, to study the manuscript
                        tradition narrating the history of the founding of a medieval collegiate church school
                        in Wales. The students did not need to know medieval Latin to work on the document
                        data
                        modeling and even to apply critical apparatus markup with a tightly controlled schema
                        combining Relax NG and Schematron, generated from a TEI ODD customization that they
                        devised and revised over the course of their project meetings. For the students and
                        my
                        History colleague involved in the project, this was their introduction to the TEI
                        critical apparatus as a document data model. Naturally, they turned to previous projects
                        from our course to follow some examples of critical apparatus markup in order to
                        understand how to prepare their own, which was distinct since the churhc history was
                        not
                        bundle of poems, but nevertheless required a modeling of textual variation over time.
                        Without needing to consult the Dickinson project team, the Brecon team was able to
                        adapt
                        and build on the example of their markup to take their own study in new directions.
                        Alyssa Argento, a returning student who was mentoring project teams and continuing
                        learning XSLT and SVG on her own, and eagerly took on a challenge of trying to show
                        how
                        the editions compared quantitatively: which editions shared the most material in common,
                        inspired by the example of the network analysis on the Dickinson project. Finding
                        her
                        computer unable to install the latest version of the network analysis software that
                        the
                        Dickinson team had relied on for their visualization, Argento studied data, worked
                        out
                        how to arrange eight witnesses as nodes in a circle, and produced a network graph
                        by
                        herself with weighted edges and sized nodes that provide a detailed visual summary
                        of
                        how much the eight different mansucripts shared in common across 25 sections of the
                        church history. Having produced a static network visualization, she then studied how
                        to
                        make it interactive by applying JavaScript to attributes on the SVG elements, and
                        associating SVG with HTML tables containing data from each of the manuscript chunks.
                        Her
                        interactive visualization, accessible at <a href="http://brecon.newtfire.org/html/analysis/network.html " class="link" target="_new">http://brecon.newtfire.org/html/analysis/network.html</a> represents work that
                        she envisioned and worked out by herself with occasional input from me and the project
                        team, and while it needs work in the documentation area, it represents a line of
                        succession from earlier projects in my course. I share it here to demonstrate what
                        is
                        possible for undergraduates to learn, very quickly, with the benefit of the XML
                        stack.</p>

                        a
                        code base. Our students show us how this work is not only writing intensive in the
                        moment of application, but intensifies over time as we learn new ways of doing things
                        and build on the model of previous projects. We understand this work to be a long
                        term
                        process in the development of a writing discipline with markup languages.</p>

                     <p> When students prepare a project in markup, they are not simply writing papers to
                        be
                        filed in a course-specific context. They are preparing a research site and their work
                        can often be continued by them or others. Students can be building beyond the
                        constraints of a single semester, and even if they are not tempted to return to the
                        project, they can leave scaffolding behind for others to continue the work or alter
                        its
                        direction, or retrieve the files. Awareness of the potential energy of the work they
                        are
                        doing can give shape to an encounter with markup languages in the course of a semester.
                        The energy input over a course of weeks puts emphasis on preparing material that others
                        can read and reuse. Assignments for a writing intensive experience can be constructed
                        with attention to:

                        a
                        project. Studying how copyright applies to code and markup and choosing a license

                        sharing the work should also be part of this experience.</p>
                     <p>Giving students access to the full set of tools in the XML arsenal and establishing

                        will introduce students from any background to the power of markup languages and with
                        the experience of writing to form and connect with communities of practice. This cannot
                        fail to be a professionalizing experience. Even in developing projects that are not
                        successful, there will be opportunities to recognize in failures what to document,
                        how
                        to redo the work differently, how another group might start over—the project-oriented
                        awareness gives space for documentation to <q>sunset</q> the work. Whether or
                        not students go on to use markup again after the course is over, they will have engaged
                        with a powerful form of writing that marks up, investigates, curates, propagates,
                        and
                        conserves textual data. This is the very definition of a writing-intensive experience
                        that is both professionalizing and cross-disciplinary in its reach. </p>

                     <h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Coda: Teaching markup languages during a pandemic</h2>
                     <p>Teaching a writing-intensive course in markup modalities offers little distress for
                        adaptation to a remote learning environment. In spring 2020, when the author’s
                        university (then the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg) closed the campus and
                        moved
                        all courses online, there was little difficulty in transferring learning materials
                        to a
                        new format because we had already been relying on tutorials and assignments we had
                        written and posted on the web, but more importantly because we had already developed
                        a
                        sense of community in the forms of asynchronous conversation cultivated not in the
                        learning management system but rather in GitHub and on Slack. Prior to the pandemic
                        quarantine, during January and February project teams already had developed asynchronous
                        connections, reinforced by their own emojis (a rubber duck meme associated with rubber
                        duck debugging, for example). The coding class might properly be recognized as
                        <q>flipped</q>, in which most of the learning was already taking place in an
                        applied context outside of class, while student and faculty class meetings reviewed
                        content all together, to learn how to interact with an unfamiliar interface or to
                        review
                        issues students are having or help address something that is not working. It was easy
                        to
                        continue the management of a course based on markup technologies in which students
                        had
                        been trained to work with project management tools and to be writing and sharing their
                        documentation in GitHub repositories and over Slack channels. We did miss the in-person
                        interaction on which this class relied, with instructors able to look over the shoulders
                        of students to help resolve a problem on their computers. Synchronous virtual meetings
                        could not replace this, but using screen captures in asynchronous chat became more
                        necessary, and students are certainly challenged to verbalize things that are not
                        working properly when an instructor cannot come around and see for themselves what
                        is
                        going wrong. But adding comments to code stored in the eXist-dB and the GitHub repo
                        continued as it always had, and because this class had cultivated tools to be able
                        to
                        communicate and work together, they were perhaps less challenged and more bonded than
                        students in the courses managed only within the learning management system. Build
                        teams
                        of developers in a class, and a pandemic may slow but not stop them. In this experience,
                        the writing intensive nature of project development becomes especially beneficial
                        in
                        organizing a community.</p>
