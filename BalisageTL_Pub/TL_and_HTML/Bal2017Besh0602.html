               <p class="title"><b>Abstract</b></p>
               <p>Digital editions were young in the 1990s, and the expansive possibilities of hypertext
                  in that decade sharply distinguish early digital editions from the productions of
                  our moment. The accessibility and simplicity of early HTML code made for innovative
                  experiments with the size of a <q>page</q> and the way one might handle displays of variants, before <q>diffing</q> tools like the Versioning Machine and Juxta came to define how we usually imagine
                  the digital comparison of texts.
               </p>
               <p>This paper investigates the serious problems and vexing potentialities of <q>up-translation</q> when standards change, concentrating on work underway on a Bicentennial Frankenstein
                  project. Our project is to produce a new, freshly collated digital edition in TEI
                  based on the <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span> texts digitized by Romantic Circles, and incorporating a little-known publication
                  of 1823 together with 1818 and 1831 versions currently represented. Readers in the
                  past century are likely to have encountered either the 1818 or the 1831 edition but
                  not the 1823, and we think that folding this text into our collation may help us to
                  understand more about when and about how gradually some of the major alterations in
                  the 1831 text (for example, to Victor Frankenstein's family members and the compression
                  and reduction of a chapter in part I) occurred. The three print editions will be compared
                  in parallel, and we will incorporate pointers to the Shelley-Godwin Archive’s edition
                  of the MS Notebooks.
               </p>
               <p>To prepare the collation we returned to the simplest original form of the current
                  edition, the Pennsylvania Electronic Edition prepared by Stuart Curran and Jack Lynch
                  in the 1990s. Exploring that edition exposes the ambitious intellectual scope of early
                  web editions and raises important questions about how we built editions then vs. now.
                  We do not build a new edition to replace the earlier work, which yet <q>lives</q> and is available on the web. But our work is a fresh start, not a seamless integration.
                  This particular project’s encounter with an impressive early hypertext edition raises
                  more general questions worthy of reflection towards theorizing the up-transformation
                  process:

            <h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Overview of the Bicentennial Frankenstein Project</h2>
            <p>In the fall of 2016, a team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the University
               of Pittsburgh, and Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) joined
               together with a goal to prepare an updated and improved digital edition of Mary Shelley's
               <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span>, conformant with current TEI P5 standard. In October 2016, Elisa Beshero-Bondar met
               with Raffaele Viglianti and Rikk Mulligan to discuss a strategy for updating <a href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/frankenstein" class="link" target="_new">the Frankenstein edition on Romantic Circles</a>. Viglianti and Beshero-Bondar subsequently met over Skype with Neil Fraistat and
               Dave Rettenmaier and agreed that by May of 2018 we would prepare a new edition to
               update the one currently published on <a href="https://www.rc.umd.edu" class="link" target="_new">Romantic Circles</a>, MITH’s refereed website on scholarly editions from the British Romantic era. Romantic
               Circles. Fraistat indicated that currently Frankenstein is by far the most clicked-on
               text in the Romantic Circles archive, so this is a site of high visibility. We initially
               agreed to improve the existing edition by collating the 1818 and 1831 editions, which
               are currently saved in two separate files and compared by viewing in Juxta Commons.
               We aimed to improve the precision of the collation by processing with <a href="https://collatex.net" class="link" target="_new">CollateX</a> software, which automates the location of alignments and deltas in multiple versions
               of a document. Processing plain text versions of the separate 1818 and 1831 edition
               files with Collatex would provide the basis for a thorough overhaul of the TEI encoding
               in the Romantic Circle's edition, because it would output a single document holding
               variations tagged according to the TEI P5 critical apparatus markup. The document
               output by Collatex is plain text that holds critical apparatus tagging, and represents
               a first phase of up-translation to a new and improved TEI document. The next stage
               would be to apply auto-tagging with regular expressions to reconstruct the <q>body</q> of the edition in TEI as a single document from which multiple editions can be generated
               for reading and for genetic studying of textual variation over time.
            </p>
            <p>Though our initial goal was to revise and improve the existing edition on Romantic
               Circles, we realized that we had an opportunity to produce a much richer edition,
               if we could incorporate a rarely studied 1823 edition of the novel into our collation.
               Incorporating this edition requires OCR of a Google Books scanned edition and careful
               correction to prepare a text file formatted consistently with the files representing
               the 1818 and 1831 editions. Finally, we would include pointers into <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/ms_abinger_c56/" class="link" target="_new">the Shelley-Godwin Archive edition of the manuscript notebook drafts</a> of the novel.
            </p>
            <p>As we began analyzing the XML code underlying the Romantic Circles edition, we discovered
               inconsistencies with the semantic standard of TEI. List elements were used to hold
               paragraphs, for example, and we learned that the TEI had been generated from an XSLT
               process of translation from a previous digital edition, the Pennsylvania Electronic
               hypertext edition produced in the 1990s. TEI elements appeared to have been selected
               for their correlation to HTML presentational elements, but we were mystified about
               the decisions to organize chapters of a novel thus:
               <pre class="programlisting">
            &lt;p rend="emph"&gt;Chapter 18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;list type="simple"&gt;
&lt;item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAY after day, week after week, passed away on my
              return to Geneva; and I
              could not collect the courage to recommence my
              work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed
              fiend,
              yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the
              task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not
              compose a female without again devoting several
              months to profound study and laborious disquisition.
              I had heard of some discoveries having been made by
              an English
              philosopher, the knowledge of which was material
              to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining
              my father's consent to visit England for this
              purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and
              shrunk from taking the first step in an undertaking
              whose immediate necessity began to appear less
              absolute to me. A change indeed had taken place in
              me: my health, which had hitherto declined, was now
              much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the
              memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My
              father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned
              his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating
              the remains of my melancholy, which every now and
              then would return by fits, and with a devouring
              blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these
              moments I took refuge in the most perfect
              solitude. I
              passed whole days on the lake alone in a little
              boat, watching the clouds, and listening to the
              rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the
              fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me
              to some degree of composure; and, on my return, I met
              the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
              and a more cheerful heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was after my return from one of these rambles
              that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed
              me:—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;


&lt;item&gt; I remembered also the
            necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
            England, or entering into a long correspondence with
            those philosophers of that country, whose knowledge and
            discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my
            present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the
            desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory:
            besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea
            of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father's
            house, while in habits of familiar intercourse with
            those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful accidents
            might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a
            tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. I was
            aware also that I should often lose all self-command,
            all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that
            would possess me during the progress of my unearthly
            occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while
            thus employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be
            achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace
            and happiness. My promise fulfilled, the monster would
            depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some
            accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him, and put
            an end to my
            slavery for ever.&lt;/item&gt;
        </pre>
               Occasionally multiple <code class="code">p</code> elements representating paragraphs in the novel might appear inside a list item,
               and occasionally the p element was missing within the item. More strange was the markup
               of poetry:
               <pre class="programlisting">
             &lt;lg&gt;
&lt;l&gt;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The
                sounding cataract&lt;lb/&gt;
                Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,&lt;lb/&gt;
                The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,&lt;lb/&gt;
                Their colours and their forms, were then to
                him&lt;lb/&gt;
                An appetite; a feeling, and a love,&lt;lb/&gt;
                That had no need of a remoter charm,&lt;lb/&gt;
                By thought supplied, or any interest&lt;lb/&gt;
                Unborrow'd from the eye"*
&lt;/l&gt;
&lt;/lg&gt;
         </pre>   
               On inquiry, we learned something of the history of the TEI preparation of the file,
               that the problem was posed by a need to convert a web 1.0 hypertext edition into TEI
               as a curatorial decision, designed to be readily published in the numbered segments
               we see visible on the Romantic Circles site. Numbering must have been accomplished
               by transformation from these hybrid <q>faux-TEI</q> list elements into HTML.          
               
            </p>
            <p>In October 2016 we experimented with text extracted directly from the Romantic Circles
               1818 and 1831 editions, and processed these with CollateX. The experience showed us
               worrisome problems at the level of the text, angle brackets poised in the text and
               other anomalies such as misnumbering and missing italics. We decided that perhaps
               the transformation that the digital Frankenstein had undergone in 2009 for Romantic
               Circles republication was not kind to the text and that to work with a reliable foundation
               for our bicentennial edition, we should return to its origin in the early 1990s hypertext
               Pennsylvania Electronic Edition. We also determined that we had better proof check
               the texts of all documents against originals. What we may have considered an <q>up-transformation</q> to meet new web standards in 2009 appears to us on close inspection to have potentially
               damaged a cleaner earlier encoding.

            <h2 class="title" style="clear: both">The Dream of 90s Hypertext: The Pennsylvania Electronic Edition</h2>
            <p>The Pennyslvania Electronic Edition (PAEE) represents a much more extensive scholarly
               effort than what is rendered of it on its supposedly updated version on Romantic Circles.
               While neither edition renders the 1823 text, whose publication was supervised by William
               Godwin, the PAEE prepared a table of hand-collected variants indicating how the 1823
               edition differs from the 1818 and 1831. Meanwhile, what appears of the better-known
               early (1818) and late (1831) publications is rendered side-by-side in old-fashioned
               (long since deprecated) HTML frames built from 238 separate HTML files (each usually
               representing a few paragraphs) of the 1818 and 249 files of the longer 1831 novel.
               The particulation of files represents an editorial method of juxtaposition of tiny
               pieces, in keeping with the hypercard format of early hypertext books. The early editors
               (Stuart Curran and Jack Lynch of the University of Pennsyvlania), took care to produce
               a highly legible, color-coded collation in hypertext, and while dates of preparation
               or publication are not clear in the files, <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/computing/printout/archive/v11/3/creature.html" class="link" target="_new">a short web publication about the edition by Curran from November 1994 in <span class="ital">Penn Magazine</span></a> indicates the production was well underway at that moment, with plans for release
               of a CD-ROM edition and non-profit production on the web. The goal appears to have
               been to reach high school and college students, and to place before them (in Curran’s
               words) <q>a convenient repository of otherwise widely scattered scholarly and critical materials</q> through which they are given an opportunities to browse, to read in a non-linear
               fashion and discover for themselves a rich store of contexts and, effectively, a way
               to read the 1818 and 1831 editions together rather than just one or the other. Curran
               described his aim as an <q>assault</q> on print-bound habits of reading: 
               
               
               <div class="blockquote">
                  <blockquote class="blockquote">
                     <p>Multiply these possibilities by the large number of ancillary texts, and you have

                        of the act of reading. One doesn’t, it is true, exactly curl up with a good book here.
                        Rather, one is faced with dozens of possibilities at once, literally replicating the
                        ways intertextual allusions play against and within any literary work of dimension
                        and intellectual ambition.

               Curran clearly had an idea that his edition was breaking new ground: <q>We are hoping to create here for the first time an electronic variorum</q>, and perhaps he did not at that moment realize that the work he and Jack Lynch were
               putting to the project to encode variants with HTML was being replicated by the Text
               Encoding Initiative, which in the same year (1994), released a draft of its P3 Guidelines,
               a draft which contained its first modeling of apparatus criticus markup with the elements
               app and rdg and their corresponding attributes. The first half of the 1990s saw intense
               drafting for the TEI in defining a standard tagset in SGML, and the irony of Curran’s
               venture with HTML seems to have placed his effort in a parallel universe, perhaps
               due to its emphasis on immediate sharing and distribution. Duplicating the efforts
               of the TEI in SGML, and bound by the semantic limitations of another specific instantiation
               of SGML in HTML 1.0 to represent descriptively the variations between two texts, the
               PAEE Frankenstein editors pioneered their own system of pseudomarkup that appears
               in a third frame running beneath the 1818 and 1831 windows, as visible on <a href="http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Colv1/f1101.html" class="link" target="_new">a representative page</a>. The pseudomarkup applies a system of square brackets and angle brackets to render
               variants inline together in the document.
            </p>
            <p>What is immediately evident is the precision and care taken in the first edition,
               even in its apparent lack of awareness of the TEI as it was developing an alternate
               SGML form in the mid 1990s. Also evident, ironically, is the net loss of information
               in the translation of the PAEE into TEI for Romantic Circles in 2009, where the difficulty
               of negotiating between HTML 1.0 and the XML standard of TEI appears to have been strained
               in favor of expressing the presentation view of the texts while removing the more
               adventurous aspects of pseudomarkup. The editorial annotations were transferred from
               the HTML to the XML syntax, no effort was made in the conversion of 2009 to apply
               the apparatus criticus of TEI to curate the handiwork in pseudomarkup of the original
               PAEE editors.
            </p>
            <p>Looking back on origins of our electronic Frankenstein monster, we see something of
               a history of strained relations between <q>chunky</q> hypertext books and <q>creamy</q> TEI which in those days applied SGML in favor of the semantics of document hierarchies
               to show interrelationships.<sup class="fn-label"><a href="#d1e201" class="footnoteref" id="d1e201-ref">[1]</a></sup> The PAEE attempted an apparatus criticus in preparing tiny hypercard <q>chunks</q> in HTML 1.0 frames as an interface that prioritized a study of variation, and even
               coded that variation in markup of their own that used angle brackets, square brackets,
               boldface, and italics to provide through the web browser interface a synoptic view
               of a variorum edition. Fortunately the edition is still served from its original University
               of Pennsyvlania URL, apparently unchanged over the years, but in a time of generational
               transference marked by rapid aging of electronic texts prepared in non-standard ways,
               the old edition’s fragility and ambition are worth contemplating now. In 2017-2018,
               we preparers of a new edition (just like our predecessors) are standing on the proverbial
               shoulders of giants, and if we are single-minded about preparing the documents in
               a format we can readily process and publish, we stand potentially to lose the scholarship
               and the impressive mass of paratext surrounding that first edition. We underestimate
               these early editions to our peril (or to our potential cultural impoverishment). Indeed,
               the PAEE contains hundreds of paratext documents, including an impressive corpus of
               other literary texts in its <a href="http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Indexes/works.html" class="link" target="_new"><q>Works Included in this Edition</q></a> bordering on and relevant to <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span>, as well an impressive array of <a href="http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Contexts/index.html" class="link" target="_new"><q>Contexts</q> pages</a> covering religious, mythical, geographic, scientific topics. Whether we can help
               preserve the vision of the first editors in interlinking contextual materials with
               their critical variorum edition, or whether we should try to do so, are open questions
               at this stage in our work on the Bicentennial Frankenstein project. Our own team,
               itself pressed for time and finding a need to invent a new expression of <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span>’s contexts, is not likely to curate the paratextual assemblage of documents in the
               PAEE, as we have prioritized for the bicentennial moment to reconstruct the electronic
               variorum and add more to it than available in the original.

               At the time of this writing in July 2017, we are beginning work on the last two stages
               of this. That is, we have successfully prepared a fresh automated collation of the
               1818, 1823, and 1831 printed editions of Frankenstein, and we are planning how to:
               
               <div class="orderedlist" id="d1e264">
                  <ol start="NaN" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                     <li id="d1e265">
                        <p>re-process the collation after we prepare a similarly formatted unified file of the
                           thousands of manuscript notebook files from the Shelley-Godwin Archive
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li id="d1e268">
                        <p>build a complete TEI edition from the collation</p>
                     </li>
                  </ol>
               </div>
               Beyond these goals of moving from chunks to large unified files for our base texts,
               we of course also face the challenge of how to share the edition with readers, not
               only scholars of the novel and its time period but also enthusiasts of the Frankenstein
               narrative, who may, if we are successful, learn something new about its textual genetics:
               how this text transformed over time. That last goal is out of scope of this paper,
               as our current project is basically to create a tractable semantically meaningful
               TEI markup building anew with a start in the PAEE files.
            </p>
            <p>My concentration for this paper is on a stage of what is completed already, and my
               sustained interaction with the PAEE hypertext edition. We first decided to process
               a predictable plain text with pseudomarkup to preserve information from the markup,
               and we decided that each stage of our up-conversion would produce a distinct and re-usable
               edition in its own right, whether in plain text, or a preliminary stage of XML for
               collation, or ultimately the collated edition in TEI P5. In this context, the PAEE
               files take on multiple <q>afterlives</q> in plain text and XML forms.
            </p>
            <p>At the time of preparation, we were uncertain whether plain text of simple XML formatting
               was best suited for collation processing, and in the course of that processing we
               discovered indeed that XML was preferable since the collation software could be programmed
               to read and process and ignore particular elements. The pseudomarkup in our plain
               text, however, served (and continues potentially to serve) as a viable intermediary
               format, trivally easy to up-translate into XML, and co-existing alongside its hierarchially
               organized kin.
            </p>
            <p>We began, then, by producing plain text from the old PAEE hypercards. The following
               documents my decisions and actions taken on the 1990s files to prepare them as plain
               text editions, prior to collation.

                           title page, prefacing material, and text of the novel.

                           because the PA EE texts were prepared as 238 and 250 separate HTML files (for the
                           1818 and 1831 editions) in order to manually align them in small <q>chunks</q> as a means to compare them visually in HTML frames. Since our edition is uniting
                           these hundreds of chunks into a single document, we will prepare new navigational
                           elements at a later stage after we have prepared our new TEI edition and are ready
                           to produce a new reading view.

                           1831 files were given names to assist with pairing them with associated chunks of
                           the 1818 edition inside HTML frames. Since we need to process the files all together
                           to output a single text of the 1818 and of the 1831 novel, we flattened the hierarchy:
                           We removed the volume directories and held each edition’s set of 238 and 250 files
                           respectively in its own directory. The files were renamed carefully to number their
                           sequence in assembling the text, and to simplify their association with the text’s
                           structural layers: the opening material, the Walton letters that frame the text at
                           its beginning and end, and the internal chapters.

               </h3>
               <p>Our translation of the PAEE into XML involves a significant intermediary step that
                  might be considered a destination in its own right: a not-so-plain text file featuring
                  pseudo-markup that preserves information from the markup. Our XSLT produces a header
                  of meta-information about the edition we are preparing, with an explanation of symbols.
                  This edition of the 1818 and 1831 text files might well be a valuable output in its
                  own right, prior to their collation. Preparing this text format and its pseudomarkup
                  establishes the basis for our new preparation of a plain text edition for the OCR'd
                  1823 edition. All three editions must be prepared in the same plain text format to
                  ensure a precise and accurate machine collation into a single file.

This is a plain text edition of the &lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="($paEdition//head[1]/tokenize(title, ', ')[2])[1]"/&gt; edition of _Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus_ by Mary Shelley &lt;xsl:text&gt;prepared for the Frankenstein Bicentennial project, which commemorates the 200th anniversary of the first published edition of this novel in 1818.

      &lt;/xsl:text&gt; 
      &lt;xsl:text&gt;This edition is part of the Pittsburgh research team's contribution to the Bicentennial Frankenstein Project, and is prepared by Elisa Beshero-Bondar of the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg with assistance from Rikk Mulligan of Carnegie Mellon University. We are grateful for consultation from Wendell Piez, David J. Birnbaum, and Raffaele Viglianti, as well as Neil Fraistat and Dave Rettenmaier. This edition's stages of development are stored and documented in the Pittsburgh_Frankenstein GitHub repository: https://github.com/ebeshero/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/ .

We have produced this plain text edition for two purposes:

1) To prepare for automated collation of the 1818, 1823, and 1831 editions of _Frankenstein_ using CollateX, in order to generate a TEI XML document that stores the variations of these texts.

2) To provide a reliable digital base text of each edition tractable for future projects.

      &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
     
     &lt;xsl:text&gt;This plain text edition is one of two, representing the 1818 and 1831 editions of the novel. This pair of editions is based on the Pennsylvania Electronic Edition of _Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus_ by Mary Shelley, edited by Stuart Curran and assisted by Jack Lynch, located at http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/ and hereafter referred to as PA EE. Elisa Beshero-Bondar and Rikk Mulligan *are correcting* these texts against photo facsimiles of the 1818 and 1831 texts. 
        * We will alter the previous sentence in this header when this phase of proof-checking is completed.
     &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
      &lt;xsl:text&gt;Our plain text edition preserves the rendering of italics, square brackets, and centered text from the PA EE HTML texts. 

* In the PA EE there is no distinction between italics for titles and italics for emphasized words. Because the asterisk is used to signal footnotes in the text, we use the underscore (`_`) instead to mark off italicized text of any kind. 

* Square brackets (`[ ]`) are placed around text marked as small caps. (We have commented out the one instance in the 1831 PA EE HTML in which square brackets were used to hold a normalized variant of a word, to suppress that from the output.) 

* Centered text is marked between percent symbols: `% %`.

* Each unit of PA EE HTML texts marked with a structural element to indicate line break (`&lt;br&gt;`) or paragraph (`&lt;p&gt;`) is produced as a unit line in the plain text. Thus, an entire paragraph appears as a single line. Every unit line is followed by two newline characters. 
      &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
      &lt;xsl:text&gt;Note for later processing: In the PA EE of this text, there are &lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="count(distinct-values($paEdition//body//a/@href))"/&gt; encoded links, each pointing to an editorial annotation.

            <h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Collation Discoveries: Flattening and Chunking Again</h2>
            <p>At the time of this writing, two members of our team completed proof-checking the
               plain text files generated by the above stages of processing against photofacsimiles
               of the nineteenth-century editions. We have undone the normalized spellings of the
               PAEE to restore the original spellings of the nineteenth-century texts, and have corrected
               transcription errors, improving what we can. We also painstakingly labored on correcting
               a plain text file generated by OCR from ABBYY Finereader of the 1823 text. We discovered
               it was best to convert these to XML (easily done with a series of Find and Replace
               operations from pseudomarkup to angle brackets). In May 2017, we processed our first
               collation of the documents, and discovered in the process that we could output plain
               text tables to align the outputs side by side, as well as XML output, both of which
               are useful. We also discovered two things that have caused us to return to revise
               substantially the documents we had prepared:
               
               <div class="orderedlist" id="d1e406">
                  <ol start="NaN" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                     <li id="d1e407">
                        <p>Collating multiple versions of a novel is highly demanding of processing power, and
                           lags considerably and may not properly locate alignments and deviations if the the
                           entire novel is processed at once. I had to prepare my XML for chunking again, with
                           larger roughly chapter-sized chunks rather than the one or two paragraphs of hypercard
                           chunking from the PAEE. That meant dispensing with structuring an elaborately hierarchical
                           document prior to machine collation: the highest level of hierachical organization
                           below the document node is a paragraph, and the structural components of the novel
                           (chapter and volume and letter divs) are signalled with milestone style elements.
                           Milestone elements are used to signal the boundaries of the pieces to be processed
                           by collateX.
                        </p>

                     <li id="d1e410">
                        <p>Once we had processed the collations, we easily saw in collateX's plain text output
                           tables many more errors to check and correct against our photofacsimiles.
                        </p>

               The irony of this is, just as we thought we might be finished with <q>stitching up</q> the body of the <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span> Creature, we discovered a necessity to break it into pieces again in order to faciliate
               collation. Collation outputs are necessarily multiple now, and must be processed again
               to stitch them together. Collation is now a recurring process, helping us to note
               corrections still to be made in our base texts. The plain text and simple XML files
               we have prepared now serve as a sort of <q>ur-text</q> still leading to our goal of preparing a new synoptic TEI document combining the
               three texts. From the process, we begin to see some new flexibility and value in flattened,
               <span class="ital">chunkable</span> XML documents.
            </p>
            <p>The need to work on the collation in small units is further exacerberated by analysis
               of the work ahead on working the manuscript notebooks into the collation with the
               print editions. At first we thought that <q>ur-text</q> file would be an XML document containing angle bracket markup in the form of critical
               apparatus tags, thus:

               This encoding (of a nonsensical and nonexistent sample passage) demonstrates our first
               plan of 2016 for interweaving three text files together with pointers into the Shelley-Godwin
               Notebooks, which combine text and image and cannot be rendered as text documents.
               Our team member at MITH and my colleague on the TEI Technical Council, Raffaele Viglianti,
               first planned to encode linkages to associated mansucript notebook facsimile pages
               in the Shelley-Godwin Archive. The pointers would lead in a published edition to links
               from our edition into related passages of the draft notebooks. However, we discovered
               a major problem with this plan on examining the output of our collation of the 1818,
               1823, and 1831 editions:
               <div class="orderedlist" id="d1e434">
                  <ol start="NaN" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                     <li id="d1e435">
                        <p>First, the collation output is much too complicated to make processing by hand particularly
                           easy.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li id="d1e438">
                        <p>Perhaps more significantly, the notebooks are themselves a variant edition in their
                           own right, and it would perhaps be more efficient to process their texts with automatic
                           collation in parallel with the print editions we have been preparing.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ol>
               </div>
               This raises a fresh set of challenges for our project. The notebook XML chunked quite
               finely, with a separate file for each page, using diplomatic TEI markup that prioritizes
               the description of each page. Line-breaks are particularly vexing because where words
               in the notebooks break at the end of the lines, there are no consistent reliable symbols
               to indicate how they are joined on the next line.  
               
            </p>
            <p>Our plan is to pull out the line elements, use the existing markup to locate paragraph,
               and preserve information about insertions and deletions in the TEI of the Shelley-Godwin
               Notebooks. The new version of XML we produce would then be more or less compatible
               with the editions we prepared of the 1818, 1823, and 1831 texts for the purposes of
               collation, working in some additional information from the diplomatic edition and
               finding a way to signal that information in the critical apparatus output. We would
               need to <q>stitch</q> the thousands of notebook pieces into the larger chunks at alignment points we can
               identify across all of the documents. This will undoubtedly prove the most challenging
               stage of our work so far.

            <p>The fragmentation of the early Frankenstein into nearly 500 pieces represents a particulated

            </p>
            <p>The survival of a particulated, chunky <span class="ital">Frankenstein</span> edition is the most remarkably persistent feature of our work thus far. We have been
               discovering that large documents with entrenched hierarchies are difficult process
               in portions. When we prepare chunks or segments of text for collation, we need to
               make sure their start and end points are aligned in some way, so we look for those
               moments of alignment and set milestone units as signal posts. But to produce tractable
               files, cutting through volume divs (for example) raises problems, particularly when
               those structural units of hierarchy are not consistent in the editions being compared.

            <p>What have we learned? We discover that deep-nested hierachies create problems when
               we need to compare different editions of the same text whose hierarchies are not aligned.
               We discover that readily fragmentable output may be preferable for indicating points
               of intersection. We consider that the process of up-conversion and up-translation
               might best produce multiple formats of output, where plain text and XML co-exist.
               We find on the path of our goal in producing a synoptic TEI edition, a desirability
               in sharing both a hierarchic document that stores information about comparison as
               well as separate edition files of each document. The imposition of structural and
               crit-apparatus hierarchy represents one interpretation of our documents, but that
               will not be the only one worth preserving over generations. Apparently, we need simple,
               granular documents, too.

                     in which documents must be fragmented into data atoms of uniform size and minimal
                     internal structure. Since few documents have historically been structured in this
                     manner, the TEl hypertext guidelines use the more flexible text-based or ‘creamy’
