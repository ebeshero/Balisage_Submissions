    <title>Text Encoding and Literate Programming for a University Writing Intensive Course</title>
   <!-- <subtitle></subtitle>-->

        <abstract>
            <para>Can learning text encoding and markup languages constitute a <quote>writing
                    intensive</quote> experience for university students? The author is developing a
                Text Encoding Fundamentals course with emphasis on text encoding as writing, as well
                as a proposal that this fulfill a major state university requirement of a
                research-oriented 300-level <quote>writing intensive</quote> or <quote>W</quote>
                course for undergraduate students. The course is specifically
                designed for those pursuing a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology major but must
                also be available to others in related disciplines as an experience in <quote>writing across the curriculum</quote>. While we may be familiar with
                arguments that coding and programming are a kind of literacy, the idea that
                developing projects with markup technologies may constitute an
                    <emphasis>intensive</emphasis> writing experience is less familiar. The
                consideration of text encoding as writing intensive may establish a call for
                teaching markup technologies more widely in a cross-disciplinary context.</para>
            <para>Not just any course introducing students to markup should be considered writing
                intensive. Arguably, a class that involves tagging exercises without project
                development and invites students to write reflectively about the experience is not
                engaging in an <emphasis>intensive</emphasis> way with the writing work we associate
                with coding in a project development context. This paper argues that a
                    <emphasis>writing intensive</emphasis> course in coding should take seriously
                the notion that coding and programming is a writing process that requires research
                and citation, algorithmic problem-solving and decision making, task management to
                organize a project team, and documentation to share the work and help others to
                build upon it. A course offering such experiences should, finally, be accessible to
                students from several disciplines, whether to a junior year English or history major
                with little to no programming experience, or a junior year computer science or
                information technology major with an interest in applied programming, unused to
                research questions that drive humanities scholarship. In presenting its case, this
                paper responds to a range of literature to evaluate the relationships among
                    <emphasis>encoding</emphasis>, <emphasis>coding</emphasis>,
                    <emphasis>programming</emphasis>, and <emphasis>writing</emphasis>.</para>

        <title>Writing intensively and across the curriculum with markup languages</title>
        <para>The XML family of languages were designed not only to be widely accessible, but also were designed to be a vocabulary the writer controls or consults or interacts with, and requires a hierarchical structuring. It does not take very long to acquaint new coders to the rules of how to tag a document, or how to turn a <quote>plain text</quote> document into an XML document, though often people experience a little frustration with typing in the attributes or figuring what they can do with attributes. The first week or two of a class that involves markup methods can orient people to how to code something in XML, but the interesting experience of that can be when we ask students to develop their own hierarchies to organize what they are reading, and when we invite our students to try to recognize what is implicit, and find ways to use elements, attributes, or comments to make that explicit. The act of inscribing markup has been recognized (CITE KATE SINGER) as a writing process, but if it goes no further than an exercise in tagging, perhaps we should consider this something like writing a reflective paper, a response that sharpens one’s observation and critical thinking skills. In my years of teaching undergraduates to code, I notice in the first couple of weeks that certain students have difficulties with conceptualizing dependencies, or what the relationship between an element and an attribute and its value ought to be. They sometimes prepare shallow hierarchies, and instead of bundling list items together in a cluster, make a very flat tree where every line is its own entry. These students benefit from seeing more detailed markup, and also from understanding something about how the markup may be processed, how it can be used to organize and access particular kinds of information. For that reason, I have found that inviting my students to write their first markup on a recipe, one that contains an interesting variety of ingredients, measurement units, and activities, provides a very clear and easily recognizable sense of structure with lots of categories of information. [CITE Newtfire XML EX 1] So, too, does a poem, or a piece of historical correspondence. Students who have difficulty constructing dependent clauses may find the preparation of an informative, non-redundant hierarchy just as challenging. Quite frequently student beginners will take the text content of a document and repeat it in an attribute value, as for example wrapping code around a name as given in a text, and using that name in an attribute value on the element, until they receive some suggestions that they might want to use the attribute as a key for a standard identifier whenever this individual is mentioned by their various names.</para>
  <para>Learning to code the XML syntax is easy. Learning to optimize one’s preparation of XML takes a long time, takes practice, and takes application, just like learning to write good sentences and paragraphs, and learning to develop a research paper or a thesis. Just like these progressively more complex writing activities, we can identify levels of intensity in increasing applications of markup technologies, and the challenges to the thinking and communication process are remarkably similar. The increasing intensity is not simply due to learning new technologies, but rather becomes gradually more intensive in cognitive ways. The process of becoming a better reader and writer and coder and developer is also the process of becoming more adept in organizing and processing information. Writing may be easily recognizable in the practice we call mere tagging in first-time coders, but the way one becomes a better writer with markup is by learning what can be done with and made from the markup. The processes of navigating, extracting, transforming, and remixing data marked in an XML tree define the <emphasis>intensive</emphasis>  part of the writing process. When students learn only tagging and do not learn how to parse their own code, they remain unaware of what the markup makes possible, and they may often be unaware of the problems imposed by imprecision and inconsistency. They may be tagging correctly, but not in a way that communicates meaningfully or reliably. Worse yet, in becoming aware of the human unreliabilities in applying markup, they may come away with the idea that the tree structures we create are arbitrary, exert an aggressive control over a document. [CITE] This line of thinking relies on an unsustained, non-intensive engagement with marked documents and an unfortunate separation of the technologies of managing and processing XML from instruction in markup.</para>      
  <para>Just as we think of free-writing as a valuable exercise to start a first preliminary draft in a composition class, in teaching markup, a certain amount of mess and unreliability is okay as we are learning or figuring out what matters to prioritize. Often new coders introduce far more differently named elements than they really need, or that would be baffling to keep track of in a real-life project. To come to an understanding of how to code helpfully and meaningfully, a student needs to confront the problem of sharing and reproducibility—concepts parallel to the awareness of an audience emphasized in rhetoric and composition classes as a means to craft better sentences, to trim out verbosity.</para>       
   <para>Students often improve their markup dramatically when they learn to write Relax NG schema code, that creates rules for encoding. This may be a first data-modeling experience for students in a general education context, when they are called upon to think in a <quote>meta</quote> or higher order reflective way about formalizing their code, and making it possible for others to understand it and reproduce it.</para>

       DATA PREPARATION: 
       up-conversion with regular expressions: pattern recognition. Useful for all kinds of text analysis, as in stemming patterns for natural language processing. In XML, a power tool for preparing a large-sized corpus of documents. 
       
       
       XSLT: constructing templates and accounting for nodes. Deciding what can be ignored. Revisiting your decisions
        Push and pull processing
        
        XQUERY and persistent datatyping
        Encounters with marked up text get you someplace different than unmarked text, and give students a constructive experience with data curation and preparation. 
        
      DOCUMENTATION and SHARING the work: establishing a context
      When students prepare a project in markup, they are not simply writing papers to be filed in a course-specific context. They are preparing a research site and their work can often be continued by them or others. Students can be building beyond the constraints of a single semester, and even if they are not tempted to return to the project, they can leave scaffolding behind for others to continue the work or alter its direction, or retrieve the files. Awareness of the potential energy of the work they are doing can give shape to an encounter with markup languages in the course of a semester. The energy input over a course of weeks puts emphasis on preparing material that others can read and reuse. Indeed, assignments for a writing intensive experience can be constructed with attention to:
      1) reading the code and documentation of other projects, and building on it
      2) preparing documentation meant to be read by peers and professor(s) working with you, and meant to be read by others who access your code from a repository.
        * Kanban board workflow management
        * README.md files
        * task lists and issues
        * being responsible and <quote>on-call</quote> for project work.
            
    These are activities to do with taking responsibility for method and processes, for managing the intellectual content of a project. Studying how copyright applies to code and markup and choosing a license for sharing the work should be part of this experience. 
    Giving students access to the full set of tools in the XML arsenal and establishing both immediate (in-semester) short-range and long-range possibilities for their work will introduce students from any background to the power of markup languages and with the experience of writing to form and connect with communities of practice. This cannot fail to be a professionalizing experience. Even in developing projects that are not successful, there will be opportunities to recognize in failures what to document, how to redo the work differently, how another group might start over—the project-oriented awareness gives space for documentation to <quote>sunset</quote> the work. Whether or not students go on to use markup again after the course is over, they will have engaged with a powerful form of writing that marks up, investigates, curates, propagates, and conserves textual data. This is the very definition of a writing-intensive experience that is both professionalizing and cross-disciplinary in its reach.
