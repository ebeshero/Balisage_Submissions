    <title>Correcting Collation Problems with XSLT</title>
    <subtitle>Untangling the Frankenstein Variorum</subtitle>
    <info>
        <abstract>
            <para>Computer-aided collation is like a power loom that inevitably tangles up threads
                in the machinery. Automating a tedious process magnifies the complexity of
                error-correction, calling for new tooling to help us smooth the weaving process. The
                authors are attempting to refine a collation algorithm to improve its alignment of
                variant passages in the <link xlink:href="https://frankensteinvariorum.github.io/"
                    >Frankenstein Variorum</link> project. In this paper we investigate how best to
                engage XSLT in the collation process, with our project files as a case study. We
                began with a Python script that tokenizes and normalizes the texts of the editions
                on spaces and delivers them to <link xlink:href="https://collatex.net/"
                    >collateX</link> for processing the collation and delivering TEI-conformant
                output for our project. Our pipeline has, to this point, applied XSLT to prepare the
                editions for collation and for post-processing following the collation to correct
                patterns of erroneous alignments. We are now experimenting with the Text Alignment
                Network's <link

                    >introduced by Joel Kalvesmaki at the Balisage 2021 conference</link>, to handle
                the string comparison completely with XPath and XSLT with a much different approach
                to the tokenization process. In this paper we discuss our experiments with collateX
                and tandiff. We seek to determine how far we can take XSLT in the preparation,
                collation, and correction process.</para>
