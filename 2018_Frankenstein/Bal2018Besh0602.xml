    <title>Stand-off Bridges in the Frankenstein Variorum Project</title>
    <subtitle>Interchange and Interoperability within TEI Markup Ecosystems</subtitle>
    <info>
        <abstract>
            <para>Developing the Frankenstein Variorum Project has necessitated a reconciliation of
                extremely divergent markup ecosystems supporting multiple editions of a single
                novel. The reconciliation process involves breaking or flattening the original
                hierarchies to prioritize units of low-level lateral intersection, points shared in
                common to construct <quote>bridge</quote> or intermediary formats for processing
                with automated collation via collateX. The output from the automated collation
                process also serves as an intermediary format that we transform into a TEI form of
                    <emphasis role="ital">stand-off parallel segmentation</emphasis>, in which
                stand-off pointing mechanisms operate like a switchboard for connecting the
                individual editions which can remain (for the most part) undisturbed or unmarked
                from the collation process. The TEI <quote>stand-off bridge</quote> negotiates the
                distinct markup ecosystems in ways that can break the <quote>silo</quote> effect of
                isolating specially encoded editions. Far from an ephemeral support structure, the
                stand-off bridge upholds the whole as the <quote>backbone</quote> of the variorum
                project because it improves the interoperability and interchangeability of all the
                markup ecosystems involved. Building the stand-off bridge effectively reconstitutes
                the hierarchies in a way that expresses intersections essentially as a graph
                structure of nodes with edge pointers to comparable nodes.</para>
            <para>Our experience on the Frankenstein Variorum is consistent with other TEI projects
                that involve the curation of divergence, variance, and forking in text streams.
                Taken together, such projects illuminate how the TEI can organize textual data in
                ways other than an ordered hierarchy of content objects, and that the TEI can be
                turned to express unordered <quote>lateral</quote> intersections in ways that serve
                long-standing goals of the TEI community: interchangeability and interoperability of
                electronic texts. As Syd Bauman in particular has discussed, where
                interchangeability reflects the capacity for humans to negotiate and adapt to markup
                ecosystems from systematic navigation and documentation without needing to contact
                the encoder for help, interoperability reflects the capacity of software tools to
                process the markup without needing to change either it or the tools. Although we
                usually consider the needs of software interoperability as at odds with the richly
                expressive capacity of human-readable semantic interchange, this paper suggests
                that the TEI can be designed to prioritize the interests of both, from facilitating
                automated collation to generating an interlinking web interface that gives the user
                means to choose and change directions in navigating multiple editions as
                desired.</para>

        <title>TEI ecosystems for digital editions: Why can’t they be interoperable <emphasis
                role="ital">and</emphasis> interchangeable?</title>
        <para>In her keynote address at the 2016 conference meeting of the Text Encoding Initiative
            in Vienna, Tara Andrews broached the issue of whether TEI can really be considered a
                <quote>de facto standard</quote> for the encoding and interchange of digital texts.<footnote>
                <para>View Andrews’s keynote <link
                        xlink:href="http://tei2016.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/keynote"><quote>Freeing Our Texts
                            from their (Digital Tool)chains</quote></link>.</para>
            </footnote> Her talk broached a long-recognized issue that the TEI Guidelines permit too
            many choices, such that there is very little that can be practically interoperable via simple programmatic mapping from one TEI project’s markup
            ecosystem to another. The TEI might well be a garden of too many forking paths, too
            richly labyrinthine because too entertaining of multiple modes of expression. Although
            Andrews’s talk specifically addressed the lack of interoperability in scholarly editions
            built with TEI and a lack of available software tools to process universally all TEI
            documents, we might take this as a more fundamental concern that the TEI has not
            fulfilled a more basic promise of its origins. That is, beyond its difficulties in
            achieving interoperability, perhaps the Text Encoding Initiative as a wild ecosystem
            fails to live up to the ideal vaunted in the title of its documentation as
                <quote>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</quote>. Perhaps,
            too, it might be said that those of us who work with TEI do not sufficiently prioritize
            either interoperability or interchangeability in our projects. The goal of universal
            interoperation may simply be unrealistic for rich variety of applications employed
            around the world for the TEI, but interoperability among related kinds of documents
            would seem practically attainable. In the case study of the Frankenstein Variorum
            project presented in this paper, we exemplify and attempt to solve the problem of
            achieving interchangeability among different digital editions of the same novel in
            variant forms, by developing intermediary stand-off markup designed to
                <quote>bridge</quote> different TEI markup ecosystems with each their own priorities
            for description and representation of the novel.</para>
        <para>Of course, to be <emphasis role="ital">interoperable</emphasis> is not the same thing
            as to be <emphasis role="ital">interchangeable</emphasis>. Syd Bauman’s definitive
            Balisage paper of 2011, <link
                xlink:href="https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol7/html/Bauman01/BalisageVol7-Bauman01.html"
                    ><quote>Interchange vs. Interoperability</quote></link> is especially helpful in
            discussing and evaluating the different priorities represented by each term.
            Interoperability (or interoperationality) depends on whether a document can be processed
            by a computer program without human intervention. Interchangeability, on the other hand,
            involves human interpretation and is supported by community-defined vocabularies and
            well-written documentation. While TEI users often wish to prioritize ready
            interoperability, as in preparing <quote>Lite</quote> or <quote>Simple</quote> code
            easily interpretable by a software tool (say, a TEI plugin for a document viewer),
            Bauman finds that this is exceedingly difficult to achieve without sacrificing
            expressive semantics to the requirements of a software package. By contrast,
            interchangeable encoding, especially encoding that permits what Bauman calls
                <quote>blind interchange</quote>, prioritizes human legibility such that
            interpreting files does not require contacting the original encoder for help in
            understanding how the data was marked. Interchangeable data achieves semantic richness
            and lasting value without needing to predict the operating systems and software
            available to deliver it. It also does not require the forced simplification that
            interoperability demands for suiting what tools are or might become available.</para>
        <para>Bauman represents these goals as at odds with one another, stressing the point that
            interoperability is a matter of machine interpretation without human intervention:
                <quote>interoperability and expressiveness are competing goals constantly in tension
                with each other. While the analogy is far from exact, interoperationality is akin to
                equality, and expressiveness is akin to liberty.</quote> The equality Bauman
            ascribes to interoperable would seem to raze the complexity of a project, levelling all
            projects to simple terms common to a convenient universal application. Perhaps, though,
            enhancing the interchangeability of documents could create better conditions for
            interoperation that do not sacrifice the complex ontologies and research questions of
            data-driven TEI markup. Much depends on how we conceive of machine interoperation, our
            awareness of the suitability (and limits) of the tools we apply, and the constructions
            we develop to <quote>cross-pollinate</quote> projects developed in distinct
            ecosystems.</para>
        <para>Traditionally, the TEI has cared about both ideals. As Elli Mylonas and Allen Renear
            discussed in 1999, TEI’s development of a language for data description and interchange
            helped to build and support an international research community with a tool for
            scholarship while also intervening in the <quote>proliferation of systems for
                representing textual material on computers. These systems were almost always
                incompatible, often poorly designed, and growing in number at nearly the same rapid
                rate as the electronic text projects themselves.</quote><footnote>

            </footnote>. While promoting blind interchange, TEI projects support development of
            specialized tools for constructing digital editions in particular, and of course this is
            where we run amok with the interoperability challenge. Optimally developers who work
            with TEI approach software tools with the caveat that some customization might be
            necessary to adapt the tool to respond to the distinctiveness of the data rather than
            the other way around, and that puts us into experimental territory as
                <quote>tinkerers</quote> or refiners of tools.</para>

                <link xlink:href="http://beta.faustedition.net/">the genetic Faust edition</link>)
            find ourselves in this intermediary third position, when multiple encoding structures

            </footnote> To produce an intermediating structure, the original hierarchies need to be
            reconceived in dynamic terms. We need to question and observe, where are their flex
            points for conversion from containment structures to loci of intersection? That, of
            course, is a determination reliant on interchange, in support of
            interoperationality.</para>
        <para>To be clear, the work we have done is in support of interoperationality across encoding ecosystems of the TEI. With this paper, we are not proclaiming the solution to make the TEI itself be inherently interoperable. 
            We cannot simply take the original TEI or early HTML of the source editions we need to compare in our Variorum project, and drop the files unmediated into a collating system to compare with one another. Indeed, as Desmond Schmidt defines interoperability, it is <quote>the
                property of data that allows it to be loaded <emphasis role="ital"

            Here the lack of ambiguity or expressiveness (or <quote><emphasis>illocutionary force</emphasis></quote> and human subjectivity that Schmidt ascribes as the significant obstacle to interoperability in the TEI), simply makes it possible for software to interpret encoding in a consistent and reliable way.<footnote><para><link xlink:href="https://journals.openedition.org/jtei/979">Desmond Schmidt, <quote>Towards an Interoperable Digital Scholarly Edition</quote>, <emphasis role="ital">Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative</emphasis> Issue , November 2014</link>.</para></footnote>. As we see it, however, interoperability is not an all-or-nothing proposition, because software tools are neither simply compatible nor incompatible with our documents.<footnote><para>Where Schmidt comments on the ability of Google Docs to represent a Word document, we recall plenty of friction between the two formats, and while it may be marvellous that web browsers can interpret HTML, they do not all interpret the specs in the same way, and as standards for CSS and JavaScript change, these methods for presentation are not always consistently experienced from browser to browser.</para></footnote> We contend that there is no perfect interoperability, even in the software tools that we expect to be universally compatible. We do not mean that designing for interoperability is never worth the trouble, but rather that all-or-nothing arguments about it are not especially helpful to the interests of textual scholarship. We assert with Martin Holmes that if designers of TEI editions want to make it easy for others to re-purpose TEI encoding, we generate alternative encodings of project-specific XML for the specific purpose of enhancing interchange. In so doing we make it possible to build the tools of interoperability that do not sacrifice the cross-walkable semantics that drive scholarship and make it possible for us to share, repurpose, and build on each others' work. We will need to interpret our own data structures to define relationships with other ecosystems, and express these relationships in what shared vocabularies we use to communicate with one another. As Holmes observes, <quote>By putting some effort into providing a range of different versions of our XML source encodings, targeted at different use-cases and user groups, we can greatly facilitate the re-use of our data in other projects; this process causes beneficial reflection on our own encoding practices, as well as an additional layer of documentation for our projects.</quote><footnote><para><link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqw048">Martin Holmes; <quote>Whatever happened to interchange?</quote></link></para></footnote></para> 
        <para>The most helpful part of Desmond Schmidt’s article of 2014 is his call to make digital editions more interoperable by working with stand-off mechanisms for annotation, with attention to intersection points in conflicting hierarchies. However, we do not see that Schmidt's solution of <quote>splitting the text into layers</quote> on its own is going to enhance the kind of interoperation we need, and our needs and interests are not uncommon in textual scholarship. We wish to be able to integrate the elaborately descriptive markup of a diplomatic edition (with additions and deletions and shifts of hands) much like the example Schmidt himself provides in <link xlink:href="https://journals.openedition.org/jtei/979#tocto1n5">section 5 of his article</link>, into a comparison with other digital editions of print versions of this work, in a way that preserves the information about handshifts encoded into the diplomatic edition (with additions and deletions and shifts of hands) and makes it available for comparison with other digital editions of print versions of this work. Indeed, we see ourselves as curating the original markup from our source documents to preserve its information within the Variorum edition we are developing. In the experience we describe in this paper, we treat the markup itself as patterned text, programmatically accessible for selective masking from the automated processes we want to run for machine collation and afterward for constructing the variorum. Dividing the complex markup of insertion and deletion events into separate layers pointing at the document might be a solution for the kind of operation Schmidt needs his limited tools to perform, but for our purposes, the source editions we are working with are long-established and not intractable to computational extraction and sequencing. Altering that markup is not really an option for us and it is so cleanly encoded and well documented that we would rather apply our computational tools to read and parse it, and to build from it rather than to reconstruct it.</para> 
        
        
        <para>From the experience of investigating diverse systems of markup applied to multiple versions of one novel from the 1990s to the 2010s, we do not find generalized dismissals of TEI markup as <quote>subjective</quote> to be compelling enough to dismiss the many information-rich projects built with the TEI over decades. Indeed, we need to work with those editions and the rich data they contain, to advance scholarship rather than reinventing it as if its encoding were value-less to outsiders. To advance the interests of scholarship involves <emphasis>respecting</emphasis> the encoding of earlier times and places, not only acknowledging its complexity and shortfalls, but building with it something that will be richly informative and available that was not before. Certainly it is difficult to find a place for a diplomatic edition in a variorum context, but when we build bridges for interchange, we create conditions for interoperation. In the case of our Variorum project, we need to do the work of interchange to make automated collation possible. Even if that collation is not perfect, and requires human intervention, can we ever expect interoperation simply to <quote>work perfectly</quote> without some human intervention? The efforts in building digital editions are necessarily complex, and we rely on interoperation to help build the very bridges we need for our Variorum edition to connect digital editions that remain in their own distinct ecosystems.</para>

        <title>Building a variorum edition from multiple sources</title>
        <para>In the process of collation, hierarchies must be dismantled and flattened in order for
            meaningful multiplicity to be represented, and in order for us to understand a dialogic
            relationship among textual variants. To study variation over time vexes the organizing
            principle of any singular hierarchy, but for an alternative bridge-building
            architecture, arches and connecting spans are more viable than monoliths. Our use of the
            terms <quote>arch</quote>, <quote>bridge</quote>, or <quote>span</quote> is more than a
            metaphor here, but drawn from a graph-based model of text on which, not coincidentally,
            collateX was designed for locating variants in documents. <footnote>

            </footnote> We are also newly incorporating a little-known edition of the novel’s 1823
            publication produced from corrected OCR of a Google Books facsimile, together with
            transcription of Mary Shelley’s handwritten revision notes on a copy of the 1818
            publication known as <quote>the Thomas copy</quote> held at the Morgan Library and Museum.<footnote>
                <para>This is known as <quote>the Thomas copy</quote> because Mary Shelley left the
                    1818 publication containing her handwritten insertions, deletions, and comments
                    with her friend Mrs. Thomas before leaving Italy for England in 1823, following
                    Percy Shelley’s death in Lerici. The edits may have been entered at any time
                    between 1818 and 1823, and they are of interest because they indicate at an
                    early stage that Mary Shelley wanted to alter many passages in her novel, and
                    was continuing to experiment with the characterization of Victor and the
                    Creature. But they also indicate a point of divergence, since she did not have
                    access to these edits in revising the novel for its 1831 publication. A key
                    motivation for collating these editions is to attempt to compare the novel as it
                    was being revised soon after its first publication (whose bicentennial we
                    celebrate in 2018) with its later incarnation in the traditionally widely read
                    1831 edition. Another is discovering just how different the 1816 draft notebooks
                    are from the later texts. Scholars over the past forty years have oscillated
                    between the 1831 and 1818 editions as the <quote>preferred</quote> texts, but
                    there is really no single canonical version of this novel, and for that reason
                    our Variorum edition does not indicate a standard <quote>base text</quote>,
                    which is still unusual in representing scholarly editions.</para>
            </footnote> Our collation should yield a meta-narrative of how <emphasis role="ital"
                >Frankenstein</emphasis> changed over time in five versions that passed through
            multiple editorial hands. It is widely understood that the 1831 edition diverges sharply
            from the first print edition of 1818, adding new material and changing the relationships
            of characters. Less known is how the notebook material compares with the print editions,
            and how much we can identify of the persistence of various hands involved in composing,
            amending, and substantially revising the novel over the three editions. For example, to
            build on Charlie Robinson’s identification of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s hand in the
            notebooks, our collation can reveal how much of Percy’s insertions and deletions survive
            in the later print editions. Our work should permit us to survey when and how the major
            changes of the 1831 text (for example, to Victor Frankenstein’s family members and the
            compression and reduction of a chapter in part I) occurred. We preserve information
            about hands, insertions, and deletions in the output collation, to serve as the basis
            for better quantifying, characterizing, and surveying the contexts of collaboration and
            revision in textual scholarship.</para>

        <para>The three print editions and extant material from three manuscripts are compared in
            parallel, to indicate the presence of variants in the other texts and to be able to
            highlight them based on intensity of variance, to be displayed like the highlighted
            passages in each visible edition of <emphasis role="ital">The Origin of
                Species</emphasis> in Darwin Online.<footnote>

            </footnote> Rather than any edition serving as the lemma or grounds for collation
            comparison, we hold the collation information in stand-off markup, in its own XML
            hierarchy. That XML <quote>bridge</quote> expresses relationships among the distinct
            encodings of diplomatic manuscript markup in which the highest level of hierarchy is a
            unit leaf of the notebook, with the structural encoding of print editions organized in
            chapters, letters, and volumes. While the apparently nested structure of these divisions
            might seem the most meaningful way to model <emphasis role="ital"
                >Frankenstein</emphasis>, these pose a challenge to textual scholarship in their own
            right. As Wendell Piez has discussed, <emphasis role="ital">Frankenstein</emphasis>’s
            overlapping hierarchies of framing letters and chapters have led to inconsistencies in
            the novel's print production. Piez deploys a non-hierarchical encoding of the novel on
            which he constructs an SVG modeling (in ordered XML syntax) of the overlap itself.<footnote>
                <para>These hierarchical issues provided an application for Piez’s invented LMNL
                        <quote>sawtooth</quote> syntax to highlight overlap as semantically

                </orderedlist>
            </para>

            <para>In the first stage, we adapt the source code from the Shelley-Godwin Archive
                (specialized TEI for the encoding of manuscript page surfaces) and from the
                Pennsylvania Electronic Edition (PAEE) (HTML 1.0 from the mid 1990s marking
                paragraphs and sectional headings) to create new forms of XML to carry predictable
                markers to assist in alignment. These new, pre-collation editions are resequenced
                (as when we move marginal annotations from the end of the XML document into their
                marked places as they would be read in the manuscript notebook). The texts from the
                PAEE are corrected against photofacsimiles of first publications of the novel in
                1818 and 1831. They are also differently <quote>chunked</quote> than their source
                texts, resizing the unit file so that each represents an equivalent portion small
                enough to collate meaningfully and large enough that each document demonstrably
                aligns with the others at its start and end points. We prepared 33 collation units
                of the novel. XML matching the pre-collation format is prepared from OCR texts of
                the 1823 edition. Building from the 1818 collation units, we add in encoded
                transcriptions of Mary Shelley's hand-written edits on <quote>the Thomas
                    copy</quote> of the 1818 publication.</para>

            <para>Stage two weaves these surrogate editions together and transfers information from
                tags that we want to preserve for the variorum. Interacting with the angle brackets
                as patterned strings with Python, we mask several elements from the diplomatic code
                of the manuscript notebooks so that they are not processed in terms of comparison
                but are nevertheless output to preserve their distinct information. In CollateX’s
                informationally-rich XML output, these tags render as flattened text with character
                entities replacing angle brackets so as not to introduce overlap problems with its
                critical apparatus.</para>
            <para>In Stage three, we work delicately with strings that represent flattened composite
                of preserved tag information and representations of the text, using XSLT
                string-manipulation functions to construct new XML and plain text (TSV or JSON)
                files for stylometric and other analysis. We can then study term frequencies and,
                for example, where the strings associated with Percy Shelley are repeated in the
                later editions, and how many were preserved by 1831. We also build the <emphasis
                    role="ital">stand-off Bridge</emphasis> in TEI for the digital variorum with its
                pointers to multiple editions, as discussed and modelled later in this paper. </para>

                comparable (including the words in the novel, and whether they are marked for
                insertion or deletion) and masks or ignores the portions of the documents that are
                not relevant for comparison purposes (including for our purposes the elements
                indicating pagination and location on a page surface). Here is a sample of the most
                elaborately marked TEI we have, from the Shelley-Godwin Archive:</para>

            <para>The markup above prioritizes description of lines on a manuscript notebook page
                surface, delineated in a zone element, and the line elements together with those
                indicating insertions and deletions pose us an obstacle course if we wish to attempt
                to compare this passage with its corresponding unit in the much simpler XML encoding
                we prepared for the print publications. One significant problem that we needed to
                solve is the way words break around the ends of lines in the notebooks. These are
                given hyphens only when present in the manuscript and are otherwise unmarked.
                Consider the challenge of comparing the sequential stream of text delineated in the
                code block above with the corresponding passage in our XML encoding of the 1818
                edition:
                <programlisting>              
      &lt;xml&gt;
   &lt;anchor type="collate" xml:id="C10"/&gt;

   &lt;head&gt;CHAPTER IV.&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I&lt;hi rend="smallcaps"&gt;T&lt;/hi&gt; was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the
            accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected
            the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the
            lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered
            dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of
            the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed
              &lt;pb xml:id="F1818_v1_110" n="098"/&gt;hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its
            limbs.&lt;/p&gt;
...
      &lt;/xml&gt;
  </programlisting>
                Note: the code above for the pre-collation version of the 1818 edition is not
                written in TEI, but borrows its elements. This is an example of simple XML we
                prepared specifically for the purpose of collation, reducing the documents to
                concentrate on the <quote>running stream</quote> of text and its basic structural
                divisions. Here the paragraph is the most basic structural division, and chapter
                boundaries are signalled with milestone markers.</para>
            <para>The act of reconciling these markup ecosystems required altering the structure of
                the S-GA markup, to produce it in an alternative pre-collation <quote>bridge</quote>
                format that matches up with elements in the encoding of the published editions,
                which in this paper we will simply call <quote>1818-style</quote>). In the S-GA
                markup the hierarchy is not especially deep, or it only becomes deep in describing
                revision activities and changes of hand. These hierarchical structures do not
                correspond with anything in the markup of the print-published editions, where
                hierarchical depth comes from chapter, letter, and volume divisions. To make a
                collatable <quote>bridge</quote> format required alteration of each (S-GA and
                1818-style) to <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><quote>meet in the middle</quote>: share matching elements that
                            contain and signal the sequence of text to be collated, and</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><quote>stay apart</quote>: preserve the diversity of metadata in the
                            S-GA markup about revisions and handshifts, and find a way to ignore or
                            mask it from the collation process.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist> To build the <quote>pre-collation bridge formats</quote>, we needed
                to flatten deep hierarchical structures from the <quote>1818-style</quote> XML
                documents by converting them into milestone-style signals. We want to retain the
                information about structural divisions, that is, paragraph, chapter, letter, and
                volume boundaries, and include this as data, since changes in paragraphing or
                chapter content are relevant to the variorum comparison of the Frankenstein
                editions. However, we also retain markup which does not designate the running
                sequence of text and basic text structure, but offers metadata about who wrote what,
                and whether the writing was inserted or deleted. This allows us to reconcile
                hierarchies that are otherwise completely at odds and nevertheless preserve their
                information, though we need to do another round of work to screen some of that
                information away from the collation process. Below is the sample passage from the
                Shelley-Godwin Notebooks rendered in our bridge format, designed to be comparable
                laterally with corresponding encoding in the 1818-style that we represented in the
                block above.

                Notice what has changed here: We not only had to flatten <code>&lt;line&gt;</code>
                elements into self-closing <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code> signals but we needed to
                actively insert <code>&lt;word&gt;</code> elements to unite whole words broken
                around the notebook lines. We also added locational <quote>flags</quote> or
                    <quote>signal beacons</quote> as the attribute on <code>&lt;lb
                n="*"/&gt;</code>, to assist us on the other side of the collation with generating
                XML pointers back to the source text: these indicate positional zones and lines on
                the notebook page surfaces, so that when output that data can be kept with its
                associated collation units. In these information-enriching activities, of course, we
                are doing the human work required of interchange, and we do so in the interests of
                interoperability, so the automated collation process can locate the same word tokens
                without interference.</para>
            <para> The <quote>pre-collation bridge format</quote> needs to retain certain marked
                metadata from the original TEI, including for example, whose hands are at work on
                the manuscript at a given moment, so we can attempt to see if a string of text
                inserted by Percy Bysshe Shelley continues to be supported in the later print
                publications. However, such metadata needs to be masked from the collation process
                so that we are not folding it into comparison of the running streams of text that
                compose each version of the novel. To deliver these <quote>pre-collation
                    bridge</quote> XML files to collateX and instruct the software collation
                algorithm on how to process them, <emphasis role="ital">with</emphasis> and
                    <emphasis role="ital">around</emphasis> their markup, we wrote a Python script
                working with its xml.dom.pulldom tool, which parses XML documents as a running
                stream of text and instructs the collation process to ignore some patterns
                surrounded by angle brackets, while actively collating the others.<footnote>
                    <para>See the xml.dom.pulldom documentation here: <link
                            xlink:href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.dom.pulldom.html"

            <para>In turn, the XML output generated by collateX itself serves as an intermediary
                format, not in TEI, but containing its components in the form of critical apparatus
                tagging, to hold information about the deltas of variance among the editions. The
                output in XML flattens the tags we submitted into angle brackets and text, and the
                shallow XML hierarchy holds only critical apparatus markup: <code>&lt;app&gt;</code>
                and its children <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> to mark divergent branches. The complexity
                of the code is such that perhaps it is for nearly illegible to human eyes and might
                best be rendered in a screen capture for our purposes. Here is a view of the
                collation output for the sample portion of <emphasis role="ital"
                    >Frankenstein</emphasis> we have been representing: <mediaobject>

                    </imageobject>
                </mediaobject></para>
            <para>While it may be difficult on human eyes, this code is information-rich and tractable for the next stage of work in building up the Variorum. Due to its
                shallow hierarchy combined with its embedded complexity, we might consider this output to be an interchange format in its own right, though we now face a challenge in processing complex details from the source editions now signalled by the pseudo-markup of the angle-bracket escape characters. In a way, this is a kind of database format from which data can be extracted and repurposed from XPath string operations, but the collation process is quite likely to break up the original tagging of <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> because it has prioritized the location of comparable text strings while <quote>masking</quote> (or parsing around) those tags. We do not treat this as an impossibility, but rather as a moment where the most interoperable portion of the document (the text characters, as Desmond Schmidt would point out), becomes something we need to address with programming tools as structured data. At the time of this writing, we are working with this output of collation to repurpose it in multiple ways:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>as a resource for analyzing the nature and variety of revisions made to the novel over time, tracing the most frequent and most extensive changes, and their locations (as in, identifying which portions of the novel were most heavily revised over time);</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>as a resource for stylometric analysis (as for example, tracking which portions of the document contain edits by Percy Shelley, and what becomes of these variants over time in later revisions to the novel);</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>as a basis for conversion into the bridge format of the reading interface, generating pointers to the source editions.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            </para>
            <para>We should clarify that these represent multiple, quite challenging processing efforts: the same XSLT that helps to generate pointers into the original editions will not suffice for dealing with insertions and deletions: indeed the goal is not to reproduce the intricately detailed page imaging of the Shelley-Godwin Archive but rather to point precisely to its pages. A different XSLT process will give us a <quote>bridge</quote> rendering of the notebooks with highlights and interactions to indicate <emphasis>how it compares</emphasis> and <emphasis>where it diverges</emphasis> from other editions, and each edition needs to be rendered individually in a way that demonstrates its own comparability and deviation from the others.</para><para>The reading interface for the Variorum edition will optimally make available the combined results of our data processing, and as a starting point, we are writing XSLT to analyze strings and locating their positions in the source documents to construct in TEI a <quote>spinal column</quote> for interconnecting the data on variation. The variorum edition architecture applies pointers in a form of <quote>stand-off parallel segmentation</quote>, which enhances the available models in the TEI
                Guidelines for stand-off collation while supporting the TEI’s longstanding
                interests in both interchange and interoperability, as we discuss below.</para>

        <title>Crossing the bridges</title>
        <para>We decided to build a variorum edition on the <quote>spine</quote> of a TEI structure
            that holds forks and branches and that does not set priorities of a base text that
            should be preferred over any of the others. The apparatus criticus itself is to hold a
            structure of stand-off pointers that locate and link to passages in each separate
            edition. Stand-off in the TEI was designed specifically to deal with non-hierarchical
            structures as a conflict with its OHCO model.<footnote>
                <para>See the <link

                        Guidelines Chapter 20: Non-Hierarchical Structures</link></para>
            </footnote> However, if we build up from a model of critical apparatus that is already
            breaking with singular hierarchy and rather expressing forks and branches, and if we
            further do not establish a single base text, we adapt the TEI tree to something more
            like a graph-based model, in which the hierarchy of elements exists so that
                <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> elements serve as bridges or edges that hold and connect
            its nodes in the form of <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> elements (for reading witnesses).<footnote>
                <para>For a visual example, a group of Pitt-Greensburg students led by Nicole
                    Lottig and Brooke Stewart experimented with a network
                    analysis of editions of Emily Dickinson's Fascicle 16 poems that share the most
                    variant readings, and to see which most closely resembled one another. See their

                    (blue reading). The pointers are expressed according to the TEI XPointer Schemes
                    defined in Chapter 16 of the TEI Guidelines and are subject to change.</para>

        <para> This example shows how the stand-off collation identifies variant readings between
            texts by grouping pointers as opposed to grouping strings of text according to the
            parallel segmentation technique described in Chapter 12 of the TEI Guidelines.<footnote>
                <para>See especially the TEI P5 Guidelines, 12.2.3 and 12.2.4: <link

            </footnote> The TEI offers a stand-off method for encoding variants, called
            “double-end-point-attachment”, in which variants can be encoded separately from the base
            text by specifying the start and end point of the lemma of which they are a variant.
            This allows encoders to refer to overlapping areas on the base text, but despite its
            flexibility, this method still requires choosing a base text to which anchor variant
            readings. While choosing a lemma for each variant may be necessary for a critical
            edition, it is not ideal for a variorum edition like ours that, by design, does not
            choose a base text.<footnote>
                <para>For a related example, see Viglianti, R. Music and Words: reconciling libretto
                    and score editions in the digital medium. “Ei, dem alten Herrn zoll’ ich Achtung
                    gern’”, ed. Kristina Richts and Peter Stadler, 2016, 727-755. </para>
            </footnote> Our approach, therefore, simply identifies variance and groups readings from
            multiple sources without conflating them into one document and with accommodation of
            multiple hierarchies.</para>


        <para>Generating the stand-off parallel segmentation requires processing and manipulating
            our multiple versions of TEI-encoded <emphasis role="ital">Frankenstein</emphasis> to
            locate the <quote>addresses</quote> of each varying point. This document is not,
            however, the end of the story: the bridges that it establishes are there to be crossed.
            Crossing the bridges, that is, following the pointers is not always trivial. Serious
            reasons for the somewhat limited use of stand-off in TEI include the limited support for
            resolving XPath, as well as the risk of not finding what was expected at the other end
            because of <quote>link rot</quote>, or because the target file was – even minimally –
            changed. In creating our stand-off collation, we tried to keep pointers as simple as
            possible by favoring locations expressed with XPath 1.0 over locations with string
            ranges (although the latter are unavoidable on multiple occasions). Finally, we made use
            of GitHub’s ability to obtain URLs to specific versions of files, which means that the
            files we point to are guaranteed not to change unexpectedly (although the URL itslef may
                <quote>rot</quote> and return a 404, eventually)<footnote>

        <para>Having taken these precautions, our primary goal is building a web-based interactive
            variorum edition that readers can use to explore each version of the text. For example,
            one could start by reading the 1818 version of the novel; highlighted text would
            indicate the presence of a variant from another version and by clicking on it, the site
            visitor would be able to <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>choose which variant readings they wish to read and compare, and</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>change their current view and pivot to a different text or grouping of
                        texts.</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>The software building this view follows links from the stand-off parallel
            segmentation to highlight text and retrieve bits of text from the other documents to be
            shown at he right place. This mode of publication adheres to well-established user
            experiences for digital editions; the fundamental difference, however, is in the
            integrity of each source document: the stand-off collation allows us to show where the
            differences are, and to retrieve them without having to modify or control the source
            documents. One can imagine an even more distributed application of this paradigm, where
            the pointers target TEI documents not owned by the project that does the pointing.
            Working with Shelley-Godwin Archive (S-GA) documents was a first experiment in this
            direction. Even though S-GA staff is directly involved in this project, we have made it
            a cornerstone of our experiment not to modify S-GA files (except the occasional typo or
            minor contribution that was sent back via a GitHub Pull Request); in short, we treated
            S-GA as an external project that we can point to but not change.</para>
        <para>Publishing the variorum is but one path that can be taken across the bridges of our
            collation. As we mentioned earlier, we kept in mind the richness of S-GA TEI documents,
            particularly regarding authorship (who wrote what) and authorial revisions. In order to
            follow a pointer to an S-GA document, we must process the full document; while it may
            seem counter-intuitive, this is an advantage because we gain access to the full context
            of the texts we address.<footnote>

            </footnote> This would allow us, for example, to determine and indicate in the user
            interface whether a variant reading was part of a revision by Percy Shelley, or allows
            us to perform larger scale operations to track such phenomena, which could then be
            plotted as visualizations.</para>

        <title>Conclusions and prospects</title>
        <para>Though we think of hierarchical XML as a stable sustainable archiving medium, the
            repeated collapsing and expansion of hierarchies in our collation process makes us
            consider that for the viability of digital textual scholarship, ordered hierarchies of
            content objects might best be designed for interchange with leveling in mind, and that building with XML
            may be optimized when it is open to transformation. Preparing diversely encoded
            documents for collation challenges us to consider inconsistent and overlapping
            hierarchies as a tractable matter for computational alignment—where alignment becomes an
            organizing principle that fractures hierarchies, chunking if not atomizing them at the
            level of the smallest meaningfully sharable semantic features.</para>
        <para>At the very least, our efforts on this project will likely result in new examples and
            enhancement of <link

            model of stand-off annotation that does not require a lemma. However, the perspective we
            have gained on enhancing interchange for the purposes of interoperation may have larger
            ramifications in the ongoing discussion of graph-based models and their application to
            the TEI.<footnote>

            scholastic textual data, on a smaller scale trained on multiple divergent encodings of
            the same famous novel, we have negotiated interchangeability by cutting across
            individual text hierarchies to emphasize lateral connections and commonalities—making a
            new TEI whose hierarchy serves as a stand-off <quote>backbone</quote> or
                <quote>switchboard</quote> permitting comparison and sharing of common data. Our
            goal of pointing to aligned data required us to locate the interchangeable structural
            markers in our source documents, and enhances interoperation by making it possible for
            software to parse the comparable with the incomparable, the similar with the
            divergent. Ultimately, we want to
            promote the long-term sustenance of digital editions by building bridges that permit monumental but isolated projects to be interchangeable rather than having to remake them from the
            ground up. Building ramps for interchangeability is an investment in
            interoperability as well, specifically for producing the comparative views afforded
            by collation.</para>
