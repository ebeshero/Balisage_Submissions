                  <para>A scholar of British Romanticism and hybrid literary genres, Dr. Beshero-Bondar earned a PhD in English Literature from Penn State University in 2003, and afterwards took a post teaching literature at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. Her publications include a book about women Romantic epoists, titled <emphasis role="ital">Women, Epic, and Transition in British Romanticism</emphasis>, published by the University of Delaware Press in 2011, and articles in <emphasis role="ital">Literature Compass</emphasis>, <emphasis role="ital">ELH</emphasis> (English Literary History), <emphasis role="ital">Genre</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="ital">Philological Quarterly</emphasis> on the poetry of Robert Southey, Mary Russell Mitford, and Lord Byron in context with 18th- and 19th-century views of revolution, world empires, natural sciences, and theater productions.</para>            
                      <para>Since earning tenure in 2011, she has applied herself adventurously to the building of digital editions and digital research projects, such as studying studying associations among physical and mythical locations in epic poetry, and teaching undergraduates the XML family of languages in the context of designing research projects. She is the director of the <link xlink:href="http://digitalmitford.org">Digital Mitford project</link>, whose two-fold mission is:
                      <orderedlist>
                          <listitem>
                              <para>to produce the first comprehensive scholarly edition of the works and letters of Mary Russell Mitford, and
                                  </para>
                          </listitem>
                          <listitem>
                              <para>to share knowledge of TEI XML and other related humanities computing practices with all serious scholars interested in contributing to the project.</para>
                          </listitem>
                      </orderedlist>
                          In keeping with the second goal, she hosts an annual coding school at Pitt-Greensburg each May or June to teach TEI, regular expression up-conversion of documents, XPath, schema design, and XSLT or XQuery, based on the interests and background of registrants. Other digital projects in which she is enmeshed include <link xlink:href="https://github.com/ebeshero/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/tree/Text_Processing">a Bicentennial Frankenstein project</link> to up-convert the 1990s electronic Frankenstein edition by 2018, and <link xlink:href="http://amadis.newtfire.org/">Amadis In Translation</link>, which applies XML to quantify, categorize, and study alterations made by Robert Southey in translating an early modern Spanish text of Amadis de Gaule. She was elected to serve on <link xlink:href="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/">the TEI Technical Council</link> from 2016-2017, and 2018-2019.</para>

        <title>Building a Variorum Edition from Multiple Sources</title>
        <para>We aimed to improve the precision of the collation by processing with <link xlink:href="https://collatex.net">CollateX</link> software, which automates the location of alignments and deltas in multiple versions of a document. The document output by CollateX is plain text that holds critical apparatus tagging, and represents a first phase of up-translation to a new and improved TEI document. The next stage would be to apply auto-tagging with regular expressions to reconstruct the <quote>body</quote> of the edition in TEI as a single document from which multiple editions can be generated for reading and for genetic studying of textual variation over time.</para>
        <para> We would include pointers into <link xlink:href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/ms_abinger_c56/">the Shelley-Godwin Archive edition of the manuscript notebook drafts</link> of the novel.</para>
