    <section><title>TEI Ecosystems for Digital Editions: Why Can’t They Be More Interchangeable?</title>
        <para>In her keynote address at the 2016 conference meeting of the Text Encoding Initiative in Vienna, Tara Andrews broached the issue of whether TEI can really be considered a <quote>de facto standard</quote> for the encoding and interchange of digital texts.<footnote><para>View Andrews’s keynote <link xlink:href="http://tei2016.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/keynote"><quote>Freeing Our Texts from their (Digital Tool)chains</quote></link>.</para></footnote> Her talk broached a long-recognized issue that the TEI Guidelines permit too many choices, so that for practical purposes there is very little that can be practically interoperable via simple programmatic mapping from one TEI project’s markup ecosystem to another. The TEI might well be seen as a garden of too many forking paths, too richly labyrinthine because too entertaining of multiple modes of expression. Although Andrews’s talk specifically addressed the lack of interoperability in scholarly editions built with TEI and a consequent lack of available software tools to process all TEI documents, we might take this as a more fundamental concern that the TEI has not fulfilled a more basic promise of its origins. That is, beyond its difficulties in achieving interoperability, perhaps the Text Encoding Initiative as a wild ecosystem or too-disconnected community of practitioners fails to live up to the ideal vaunted in the title of its documentation as <quote>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</quote>. Perhaps, too, it might be said that those of us who work with TEI do not sufficiently prioritize either interoperability or interchangeability in our projects: do we think beyond the end of a project horizon or grant funding cycle? In the case study of the Frankenstein Variorum project presented in this paper, we exemplify and attempt to solve the problem of achieving interchangeability among different digital editions of a single literary work, by developing intermediary stand-off markup designed to <quote>bridge</quote> exceedingly different TEI markup ecosystems.</para>
        <para><!--Here, review the differences between interoperability and interchange, via Martin Holmes and Syd.-->At this point, it is important to distinguish the terms <emphasis>interoperable</emphasis> and <emphasis>interchangeable</emphasis>. For this, Syd Bauman’s Balisage paper of 2011, <link xlink:href="https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol7/html/Bauman01/BalisageVol7-Bauman01.html"><quote>Interchange vs. Interoperability</quote></link> is especially helpful in discussing and evaluating the different priorities represented by each term. Interoperability (or interoperationality) depends on whether a document can be processed by a computer program without human intervention. Interchangeability, on the other hand, involves human interpretation and is supported by documentation. While TEI users often wish to prioritize easy interoperability, as in easily interpretable by a software tool (say, a TEI plugin for a document viewer), Bauman indicates this is exceedingly difficult to achieve without sacrificing expressive semantics. On the other hand, Bauman places a higher value on interchangeable encoding, and more specifically encoding that makes possible <quote>blind interchange</quote>, which is adaptable by human beings by downloading and working with the files to access their data, without needing to contact the original encoder for help in understanding how the data was marked. Such data, attainable by the TEI, achieves semantic richness and lasting value without needing to predict the operating systems and software available to deliver it. It also does not require the forced simplification that interoperability demands for suiting what tools are or might become available.</para>
        <para>Bauman’s paper suggests the terms represent conflicting goals, as indeed they might if we consider that interoperability is a matter of machine interpretation without human intervention. As Bauman writes, <quote>interoperability and expressiveness are competing goals constantly in tension with each other. While the analogy is far from exact, interoperationality is akin to equality, and expressiveness is akin to liberty.</quote> Perhaps, though, enhancing the interchangeability of documents could also improve their interoperability.  
   A) Indicated that at least since TEI P5, the emphasis of the TEI has been on supporting interoperability as much as it can, and emphasis has moved away from interchange.
   B) Interoperability (or interoperationality) depends on whether a document can be processed by a computer program without human intervention. Interchange, on the other hand, involves human adaptation, and is easier to support with documentation. <quote>The reason it takes work to make a file interchangeable is because (in general) it requires that the semantics, not just the syntax, of the encoding be explained to the humans involved with consuming the file. </quote>
   <!--Gems from Syd: -->
       <!--interoperability in context with interchange -->
       <quote>interoperability and expressiveness are competing goals constantly in tension with each other. While the analogy is far from exact, interoperationality is akin to equality, and expressiveness is akin to liberty. </quote>
       <quote>In the general case, interoperationality (at least of random TEI-encoded files) is impossible. But that does not stop encoders from striving for it, and in so doing curtailing their own ability to express the features of interest to them in individual ways. While this is not always a bad thing, differing expressions of content are part of the force driving scholarship forward and cannot be entirely forsaken for the short-term goal of avoiding the work needed for interchange as opposed to interoperation.</quote>
       <!--optimal recommendation: Blind Interchange should be the goal for TEI encoders: -->
       <!--Syd's definition of blind interchange; -->
       <quote>you want my data; you go to my website or load my CD and download or copy both the data of interest and any associated files (e.g., documentation or specifications like a TEI ODD, a METS profile, or the Balisage tag library); based on your knowledge of my data that comes from either the documents themselves or from the associated files (or both), you either change my data to suit your system or change your system to suit my data as needed. Human intervention, but not direct communication, is required.</quote>
       <!--interoperability demands and challenges -->
       <quote>interoperationality is not just about use of XML data in current predicted applications (I will want to use this file in an SVG viewer), but rather is also concerned with the use of data with both unintended applications (e.g., linguistic analysis of survey questions) and future applications</quote>
       <quote>interoperationality is very context dependent</quote> (that is, it depends on what programs or applications will operate on the document, whether or not the encoder can predict those programs or applications: <quote>We cannot know the various contexts in which we would like our files achieve interoperationality.</quote>
       <quote>(Remember that TEI, like many languages, is really a framework for building a particular markup language with many, but not all, features in common with other TEI languages.)</quote> 
       <!--Syd uses the case of end-of-line soft vs. hard hyphenation as a serious issue of interoperability  -->
       <quote>The TEI currently (P5 v. 1.9.1) provides at least five different methods for encoding soft hyphens at end-of-line, three of which might use different characters for the representation of the hyphen itself (which is displayed as a hyphen (U+002D) in the listing below), and some previous releases of TEI allowed even more. This may strike some as silly or even excessive, but in most cases these choices make sense. For example, the TEI cannot prescribe to scholars who are not remotely interested in original lineation or soft hyphens that they record these features.</quote><quote>The good news is that TEI does actually provide a specific construct[6] for encoding how end-of-line hyphens are handled. The bad news is that the vocabulary available to describe the different encodings is insufficient to the task; furthermore, it is optional, and many, if not most, projects do not use it</quote>

        <title>Building a Variorum Edition from Multiple Sources</title>
        <para>We aimed to improve the precision of the collation by processing with <link xlink:href="https://collatex.net">CollateX</link> software, which automates the location of alignments and deltas in multiple versions of a document. The document output by CollateX is plain text that holds critical apparatus tagging, and represents a first phase of up-translation to a new and improved TEI document. The next stage would be to apply auto-tagging with regular expressions to reconstruct the <quote>body</quote> of the edition in TEI as a single document from which multiple editions can be generated for reading and for genetic studying of textual variation over time.</para>
        <para> We would include pointers into <link xlink:href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/ms_abinger_c56/">the Shelley-Godwin Archive edition of the manuscript notebook drafts</link> of the novel.</para>
