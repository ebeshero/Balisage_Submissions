    <title>Standoff Bridges in the Frankenstein Variorum Project</title>
    <subtitle>Interchange and Interoperability within TEI Markup Ecosystems</subtitle>
    <info>
        <abstract>
            <para>Developing the Frankenstein Variorum Project has necessitated a reconciliation of
                extremely divergent markup ecosystems supporting multiple editions of a single
                novel. The reconciliation process involves breaking or flattening the original
                hierarchies to prioritize units of low-level lateral intersection, points shared in
                common to construct <quote>bridge</quote> or intermediary formats for processing
                with automated collation via collateX. The output from the automated collation
                process also serves as an intermediary format that we transform into a TEI form of
                <emphasis>standoff parallel segmentation</emphasis>, in which
                standoff pointing mechanisms operate like a switchboard for connecting the individual editions
                which can remain (for the most part) undisturbed or unmarked from the collation
                process. The TEI <quote>standoff bridge</quote> negotiates the distinct markup
                ecosystems in ways that can break the <quote>silo</quote> effect of isolating
                specially encoded editions. Far from an ephemeral support structure, the standoff
                bridge upholds the whole as the <quote>backbone</quote> of the variorum project
                because it improves the interoperability and interchangeability of all the markup
                ecosystems involved. Building the standoff bridge effectively reconstitutes the
                hierarchies in a way that expresses intersections essentially as a graph structure
                of nodes with edge pointers to comparable nodes.</para>
            <para>Our experience on the Frankenstein Variorum is consistent with other TEI projects
                that involve curating divergence, variance, and forking in text streams. Taken
                together, such projects illuminate how the TEI can work in other ways besides an
                ordered hierarchy of content objects, that indeed, the TEI can be turned to express
                unordered <quote>lateral</quote> intersections in ways that serve long-standing
                goals of the TEI community: interchangeability and interoperability of electronic
                texts. As Syd Bauman in particular has discussed, where interchangeability reflects
                the capacity for humans to negotiate and adapt to markup ecosystems from systematic
                navigation and documentation without needing to contact the encoder for help,
                interoperability reflects the capacity of software tools to process the markup
                without needing to change the markup (or the tool). Although we usually consider the
                needs of software interoperability as at odds with the richly expressive capacity of
                human-readable semantic interchange, this paper demonstrates that the TEI can be
                designed to prioritize the interests of both, from facilitating automated collation
                to generating an interlinking web interface that gives the user means to choose and
                change directions in navigating multiple editions as desired.</para>
