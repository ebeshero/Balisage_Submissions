               <p id="d2e11">Is invisible XML ready for the undergraduate educational arena? In spring semester
                  2025, we have been testing what it takes for
                  university students in the Digital Media, Arts, and Technology program at Penn State
                  Behrend to try writing invisible XML to represent 
                  text documents as a grammar in preparing XML on the way to becoming tractable for
                  use in real semester text analysis projects. This paper
                  will share what students have to gain from learning how to install and tinker with
                  software in alpha stages and test how well it works across platforms.
                  It will also share some areas that challenged students and professors alike, as well
                  as suggestions on best practices in guiding people to prepare processing pipelines
                  (with XProc) that incorporate ixml. Further, this paper will reflect on why this adventure
                  was worthwhile. </p>
               <p id="d2e13">Context: The Large-Scale Text Analysis class is taught
                  in Spring semesters as part of a multiple-semester sequence: Students came to this
                  class with previous Fall experience in text encoding with XML, transformation with
                  XSLT, and web development with HTML and CSS, and semesters provide about 15 weeks
                  with three 50-minute classes per week, regular daily homework and a few tests, and
                  a strong emphasis on developing projects in teams. The spring Text Analysis class
                  is usually <q>the Python-and-Regex course</q>, and it usually involves preparing text corpora by generating simple XML from regularly-patterned
                  files using search-and-replace operations using regular expressions. Students would
                  then learn some XQuery to output portions of the texts they wish to analyze using
                  Natural Language Processing libraries (spaCy or NLTK). For example, students could
                  <q>scrape</q> collections of popular game script files and choose to output the texts that described
                  decision making forks, or find out how frequently certain characters and items are
                  mentioned at specific locations in the game. Or, students exploring readily-available
                  TV script files like <span class="ital">The Simpsons</span> could explore characters' use of language, and once they had prepared simple XML
                  to identify dialogue, speakers, and non-spoken descriptive passages, they could use
                  XQuery to separate out just the portions of the texts they wished to analyze in plain-text
                  inputs to provide to Python. We could even import the Saxon-C package to have students
                  apply XPath and XQuery directly within their Python scripts. Previously, Python dominated
                  the experience of the pipeline algorithm. This year, however, by introducing Invisible
                  XML, we also could introduce XProc and formalize the work students did with grammar
                  writing, schema writing, and regular expression matching (via XSLT) in an XML stack
                  first, before beginning work with Python.</p>
               <p id="d2e25">Adding Invisible XML to the course certainly changed the students’ learning experience.
                  At the time of this writing, beginning the last month of the course, the author finds
                  that students approach Python with better understanding of algorithmic pipelines,
                  more clarity and less trouble with installation processes, and especially greater
                  comfort with command line processes. There is something more: The appreciation of
                  declarative methods is balanced differently with the imperative programming of Python.
                  Are students understanding the formatting and processing of text differently when
                  encountering Invisible XML? At this preliminary stage of writing, it seems to me that
                  students did not necessarily significantly benefit in a practical way for their projects
                  from learning Invisible XML, but encountered it as an option alongside regular expression
                  search-and-replace operations on the way to cleaning and preparing their text corpora.
                  But in making Invisible XML a topic for homework and demonstration, students encountered
                  the concept of grammars, in context with schema validation and regular expression
                  matching—related to these but fundamentally different. The declaration of patterns,
                  and the experience of writing grammars explicitly to work across platforms (Windows,
                  Mac, Linux systems) may have enriched their experience of moving between declarative
                  and imperative methods of text handling, and helped them to reflect on a certain fluidity
                  of methods. The experience caused the author to find a place to assert the value of
                  declarative methods in the 2020s, a time when natural language processing of sequential
                  strings dominates the development of Large Language Models and <q>artificial intelligence</q>. The movement from <q>raw text</q> to identifying structures as nodes, and then extracting text from nodes for meaningful
                  natural language processing, with findings expressed, visualized, and output on websites
                  involves a round-trip adventure with text and code formats. Why is Invisible XML beneficial
                  to students to learn in this process? The identification of structures involves onstructing
                  one's own pattern recognition as XML, and being able to script the rules and structures
                  makes for a multi-dimensional experience of text, both as architectures and as streams.
                  Furthermore, finding our way with this helps us to understand there are distinct cultures
                  in text analysis that benefit from being studied together.
